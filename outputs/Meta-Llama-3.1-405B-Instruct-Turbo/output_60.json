The algorithm uses two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, that move at different speeds through the list. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list. The function returns `True` if a cycle is detected and `False` otherwise. The `@timer` decorator is used to profile the function and identify any performance bottlenecks, as per the mentor's guidance."
