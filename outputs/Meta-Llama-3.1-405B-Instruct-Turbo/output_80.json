The `dijkstra_md` method computes the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes, and the `shortest_path_md` method uses this information to find the shortest distance from the start node to the end node. The graph is represented as a set of nodes and a dictionary of edges, where each edge is associated with a distance. The distances are stored in a separate dictionary to make it easier to access and update them."
