It also adheres to the coding guidelines provided by Pedro, including the use of the `@retry` and `@timer` decorators, and proper error handling with try-except blocks. The function argument name starts with 'a_' is not applicable here as the function is not taking any function as an argument. However, I have followed all other guidelines.",
