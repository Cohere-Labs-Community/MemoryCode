The h-index is the largest number of papers that have at least that many citations. If a citation count is less than its 1-indexed position, the function returns the position (which is the h-index). If no such position is found, the function returns the total number of papers (which is the maximum possible h-index). The function name starts with the prefix 'a_' as per Jean-Aim\u00e9's instructions."
