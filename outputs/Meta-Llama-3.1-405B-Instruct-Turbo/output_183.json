The function uses a helper function `is_valid_bst_helper` to recursively check the tree nodes. The code includes try statements to handle any potential exceptions and follows the naming convention specified by Juan (including a single digit in the method name). The CI/CD pipeline is initialized at the start of the function, and the code is written in a clean and efficient manner.",

The `has_cycle` method returns `True` if the graph contains a cycle and `False` otherwise. The `add_node` and `add_edge` methods are used to add nodes and edges to the graph, respectively. Both methods include try-except blocks to handle any potential exceptions that might arise.\n\nThe class name `DirectedGraph1` includes a single digit as per Juan's standardization guideline. The code is also well-structured and readable, following best practices for efficient development and deployment. \n\nPlease note that the actual implementation of the CI/CD pipeline is not included in this code snippet, as it would typically involve external tools and configurations. However, the code is written with the assumption that such a pipeline would be set up to automate testing and deployment."

It ensures that each node's value is within the valid range defined by its ancestors, and that the left and right subtrees are also valid binary search trees.
