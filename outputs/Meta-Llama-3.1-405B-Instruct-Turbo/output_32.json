        "Here's a Python implementation of a Graph class with a method to compute the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. I've followed the coding convention provided by Sophie, ending the method name with '_n'.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.nodes = set()\n        self.edges = {}\n        self.distances = {}\n\n    def add_node_n(self, value):\n        self.nodes.add(value)\n        if value not in self.edges:\n            self.edges[value] = []\n\n    def add_edge_n(self, from_node, to_node, distance):\n        self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)\n        self.distances[(from_node, to_node)] = distance\n\n    def dijkstra_n(self, start_node):\n        distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in self.nodes}\n        distances[start_node] = 0\n        queue = [(0, start_node)]\n\n        while queue:\n            current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n\n            if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n                continue\n\n            for neighbor in self.edges[current_node]:\n                distance = current_distance + self.distances[(current_node, neighbor)]\n\n                if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                    distances[neighbor] = distance\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))\n\n        return distances\n\n    def shortest_path_n(self, start_node, end_node):\n        distances = self.dijkstra_n(start_node)\n        return distances[end_node]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a priority queue to efficiently explore the nodes with the shortest distance first. The `dijkstra_n` method computes the shortest distance from the start node to all other nodes, and the `shortest_path_n` method returns the shortest distance from the start node to a specific end node."

The graph is represented as a set of nodes and a dictionary of edges, where each edge is associated with a distance. The `add_node_n` and `add_edge_n` methods are used to add nodes and edges to the graph."
