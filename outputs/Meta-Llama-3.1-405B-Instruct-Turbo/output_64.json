        "Here's a Python function that calculates the h-index given an array of integer citations. This function adheres to the coding standards and practices discussed with the mentor, including the use of a pre-commit hook for code quality and the 'x_' prefix for function names.\n\n```python\ndef x_compute_h_index(citations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the h-index given an array of integer citations.\n\n    The h-index is a metric that measures the productivity and citation impact of a researcher.\n    It is defined as the largest number of papers included in the h-index, which have at least as many citations as the number of papers.\n\n    :param citations: A list of integers representing the number of citations for each paper.\n    :return: The h-index of the researcher.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not citations:\n        return 0\n\n    # Sort the citations in descending order\n    citations.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Initialize the h-index to 0\n    h_index = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the sorted citations\n    for i, citation in enumerate(citations):\n        # Calculate the h-index for the current paper\n        current_h_index = min(citation, i + 1)\n\n        # Update the overall h-index if the current h-index is larger\n        h_index = max(h_index, current_h_index)\n\n    # Return the computed h-index\n    return h_index\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and returns 0 in that case. It then sorts the citations in descending order and initializes the h-index to 0. The function iterates over the sorted citations, calculates the h-index for each paper, and updates the overall h-index if the current h-index is larger. Finally, it returns the computed h-index.\n\nNote that this function uses the 'x_' prefix for the function name as per the mentor's guidelines. Additionally, the function includes a docstring that provides a description of the function, its parameters, and its return value, following standard Python documentation practices."
