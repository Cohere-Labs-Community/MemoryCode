The `LRUCache` class uses an `OrderedDict` to store the cache items, which allows for efficient insertion and removal of items while maintaining the order of recent usage. The `get` and `put` methods implement the LRU cache behavior, with the `put` method handling the case where the cache is full by removing the least recently used item.",
