The variable name `s` is used to store the input string, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not. The function also removes non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase before checking for palindromes."

The variable name `s` is followed by the type hint `str`, and the function name `is_palindrome` is descriptive and follows the convention of ending with `_n` (although in this case, it's not necessary since the function name is a verb). The docstring explains the purpose of the function, its arguments, and its return value. The code is also concise and readable, with a clear structure and minimal comments."
