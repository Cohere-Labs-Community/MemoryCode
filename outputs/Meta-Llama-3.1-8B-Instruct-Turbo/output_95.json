The `p_add_stock` method adds stock to the inventory, and the `p_remove_stock` method removes stock from the inventory. Both methods raise a ValueError if the quantity is negative. The `p_remove_stock` method also raises a ValueError if the item is not found in the inventory or if there is not enough stock to remove."
