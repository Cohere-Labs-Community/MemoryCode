Consistency: Variable names are consistent and follow the convention of ending with an underscore.\n2. Documentation: The function includes a clear and concise docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and return value.\n3. Readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and a logical flow.\n\nNote: The `isalnum()` method is used to remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the string, and the `lower()` method is used to convert the string to lowercase, as these are common operations when checking for palindromes. The `[::-1]` slice is used to reverse the string."

Documentation: The function includes a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and return value.\n3. Readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and concise comments.\n4. Maintainability: The function is designed to be flexible and adaptable, with a clear separation of concerns and a focus on simplicity.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input string is not empty. If you need to handle empty strings, you can add a simple check at the beginning of the function."
