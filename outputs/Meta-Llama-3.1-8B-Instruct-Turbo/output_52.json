The `merge_sort_fn` function recursively splits the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them using the `merge_fn` function, and then merges the sorted subarrays back together. The `merge_fn` function merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array by comparing elements from both arrays and appending the smaller element to the merged array.",

The docstring also includes a description of the function's behavior and any exceptions it may raise. \n\nThe function is well-structured and easy to read, with clear and concise variable names and a logical flow of code. The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the first string, and it uses a conditional statement to check if the characters in the first and last strings are the same. \n\nThe function raises a ValueError if the input list is empty, which is a good practice to ensure that the function is used correctly. \n\nOverall, the function is well-written and follows the coding guidelines provided by your mentor.",
