It uses two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to traverse the linked list. If there is a cycle in the list, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list. The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the `slow` and `fast` pointers."

It maintains two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, which move at different speeds through the list. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list."

I've also included the `@timer` decorator as per Michael's suggestion, but since this function doesn't have any performance-critical operations, it's not necessary in this case. However, I've kept it in the code as per the guidelines. \n\nAlso, I've used the `ListNode` type hint, assuming that it's a custom class representing a node in the linked list. If it's not defined, you can replace it with the actual class name or remove it altogether. \n\nFinally, I've kept the function name and docstring concise and clear, following the guidelines for writing clean and readable code."
