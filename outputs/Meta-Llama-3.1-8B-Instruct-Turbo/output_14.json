It creates a matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`. The function then fills in the matrix row by row, considering the minimum edit cost of the three operations (insertion, deletion, and substitution) at each step. The edit distance is finally returned as the value stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix.",
