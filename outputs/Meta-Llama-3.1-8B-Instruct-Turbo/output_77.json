        "Here's the function that detects a cycle in a linked list, following the latest coding guidelines and incorporating the `@timer` decorator from the `pedantic` module:\n\n```python\nimport pedantic\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass ListNode:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in a singly linked list.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, x: int):\n        self.val = x\n        self.next = None\n\n@pedantic.timer\ndef has_cycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a linked list has a cycle in it.\n\n    Args:\n    head: The head of the linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n    True if the linked list has a cycle, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not head or not head.next:\n        return False  # A linked list with less than two nodes cannot have a cycle.\n\n    slow = head\n    fast = head.next\n\n    while slow != fast:\n        if not fast or not fast.next:\n            return False  # If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, there's no cycle.\n\n        slow = slow.next\n        fast = fast.next.next\n\n    return True  # If the slow and fast pointers meet, there's a cycle.\n```\n\nThis function uses the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the \"tortoise and the hare\" algorithm, to detect a cycle in the linked list. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the slow and fast pointers."

It maintains two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, which move at different speeds through the list. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list."
