It initializes a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2`. The function then fills in the table by considering the minimum cost of inserting, deleting, or substituting a character. The final result is stored in `dp[m][n]`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively."
