It includes methods for adding nodes and edges, computing the shortest path between two nodes, and retrieving node and edge attributes. The class also includes methods for updating edge and node attributes, as well as retrieving the degree of a node and the weight of an edge.\n\nNote that the method names end with '_ud' as per the latest coding standard provided by the mentor. Also, the 'locale' module is imported as per the mentor's instruction, even though it's not used in this specific code snippet.",

It also adheres to the naming convention of ending method names with '_n' (although this has been updated to '_ud' in Session 4). The function is well-structured and easy to understand, making it suitable for a collaborative environment."
