The `predict` method checks if the input is a 2D numpy array and makes predictions using the trained model.

        "**H-Index Calculation Function**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe H-Index is a metric used to evaluate the productivity and citation impact of a researcher or a publication. It is defined as the highest number of citations that a researcher has received for a given number of publications, such that the citations are at least as many as the publications.\n\n### Function Implementation\n\n```python\ndef h_index(citations: list[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the H-Index given an array of integer citations.\n\n    Args:\n    citations (list[int]): A list of integer citations.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The H-Index value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the citations in descending order\n    citations.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Initialize the H-Index value to 0\n    h_index = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the sorted citations\n    for i, citation in enumerate(citations):\n        # If the current citation is greater than or equal to the current index + 1,\n        # update the H-Index value\n        if citation >= i + 1:\n            h_index = i + 1\n        # If the current citation is less than the current index + 1, break the loop\n        else:\n            break\n\n    return h_index\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function takes a list of integer citations as input and sorts it in descending order.\n2. It initializes the H-Index value to 0.\n3. It iterates over the sorted citations, and for each citation, it checks if it is greater than or equal to the current index + 1.\n4. If the condition is met, it updates the H-Index value to the current index + 1.\n5. If the condition is not met, it breaks the loop.\n6. Finally, it returns the H-Index value.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of citations.\n* The function assumes that the input list is not empty and contains only non-negative integers.\n* The H-Index value is returned as an integer, which means it will be capped at the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in Python."

Then it iterates over the sorted citations. If it finds a citation that is less than the current index + 1, it returns the current index as the h-index. If it doesn't find such a citation, it means that all citations are greater than or equal to the length of the citations list, so it returns the length of the citations list as the h-index."
