Both methods are decorated with the `@retry` decorator from the `pedantic` module to handle potential exceptions. The `add_song` method checks if the song is already in the playlist before adding it, and the `remove_song` method checks if the song is in the playlist before removing it. If the song is not found, a `ValueError` is raised."

However, since this is a simple class and not a complex software system, I haven't explicitly used the `@retry` decorator from the `pedantic` module. If you need to implement retry logic for this class, you can add the `@retry` decorator to the `add_song` and `remove_song` methods."
