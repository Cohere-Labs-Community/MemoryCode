Consistent naming convention: Variable names end with `_n` (e.g., `nums_n`).\n2. Function annotations: The function is annotated with a description, input parameters, and return type.\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use a heap-based approach or a sorting algorithm with a better time complexity. However, for this specific problem, the sorting approach is straightforward and easy to understand."
