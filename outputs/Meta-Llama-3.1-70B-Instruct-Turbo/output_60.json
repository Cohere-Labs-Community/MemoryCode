The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list.

The algorithm uses two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer, to traverse the linked list. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list. The function returns True if a cycle is detected and False otherwise.
