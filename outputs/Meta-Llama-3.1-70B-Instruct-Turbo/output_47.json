The `Library` class has methods to add and remove books, with clear documentation and type hints. The `remove_book` method also includes a check to ensure the book is in the library before attempting to remove it, raising a `ValueError` if it is not found."

The `Book` class represents a book with a title and author, while the `Library` class represents a library that can store and manage books. The `Library` class has methods to add and remove books, both of which are decorated with the `@validate` decorator from the `pedantic` module to ensure that the method arguments are valid."

The `Library` class has methods to add and remove books, with the `add_book` method adding a book to the library and the `remove_book` method removing a book from the library.
