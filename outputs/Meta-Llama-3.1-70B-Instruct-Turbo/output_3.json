Both methods are decorated with the `@retry` decorator from the `pedantic` module, as per the guidance provided by the mentor. The `add_song` method checks if the song is a string before adding it to the playlist, and the `remove_song` method checks if the song is in the playlist before removing it. If either of these checks fail, a `TypeError` or `ValueError` is raised, respectively."

Both methods are decorated with the `@retry` decorator from the `pedantic` module, as per the guidance provided by Emma. This ensures that the methods will be retried if they fail, which can help with error handling and resilience in the code."
