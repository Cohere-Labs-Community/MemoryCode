It takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix string. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty string. The function iterates over the characters of the shortest string in the list and checks if the same character is present at the same position in all other strings. If a mismatch is found, it returns the common prefix up to that point. If no mismatch is found, it returns the entire shortest string, which is the longest common prefix.",

The `add_edge_o` method allows you to add edges between nodes, and the `shortest_path_o` method computes the shortest path from a start node to an end node. The graph is represented using an adjacency list, which is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is another dictionary containing the node's neighbors and the edge weights."
