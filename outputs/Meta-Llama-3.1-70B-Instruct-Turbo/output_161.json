The `train` method takes in the training data and labels, and the `predict` method takes in the test data and returns the predicted labels. The model uses the `scipy.spatial.distance` module to calculate the distances between the test samples and the training samples, and the `numpy` module to perform array operations. The `assert` statements are used to validate the inputs to the methods."

The `LassoRegression` class includes a `train` method for training the model and a `predict` method for making predictions. The `soft_thresholding` function is used to apply the soft thresholding operation in the Lasso Regression algorithm.",
