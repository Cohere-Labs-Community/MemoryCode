The `insert_node_o` method inserts a new node into the binary tree, and the `delete_node_o` method deletes a node from the binary tree. The `_insert_node_o` and `_delete_node_o` methods are helper methods used by the `insert_node_o` and `delete_node_o` methods, respectively. The `_find_min_node_o` method is used to find the node with the minimum value in a subtree.",
