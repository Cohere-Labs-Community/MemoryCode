Then, it iterates over the sorted citations, updating the h-index whenever it finds a citation that is greater than or equal to the current index + 1. The loop breaks when it finds a citation that is less than the current index + 1, as the h-index cannot be higher than this point. The function finally returns the computed h-index."

        "### Computing the H-Index\n\nThe h-index is a metric used to evaluate the productivity and citation impact of a researcher's body of work. It is defined as the largest number of papers (h) that have at least h citations.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef x_compute_h_index(citations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the h-index given an array of integer citations.\n\n    Args:\n    citations (list): A list of integers representing the number of citations for each paper.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The h-index.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the citations in descending order\n    citations.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Initialize the h-index to 0\n    h_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted citations\n    for i, citation in enumerate(citations):\n        # If the current citation count is greater than or equal to the paper's index + 1\n        if citation >= i + 1:\n            # Update the h-index\n            h_index = i + 1\n        else:\n            # If the current citation count is less than the paper's index + 1, break the loop\n            break\n    \n    return h_index\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThis function works by first sorting the citations in descending order. It then iterates over the sorted citations, updating the h-index whenever it finds a citation count that is greater than or equal to the paper's index + 1. The loop breaks when it finds a citation count that is less than the paper's index + 1, as the h-index cannot be higher than this point."

The h-index is the largest number of publications that have at least that many citations. If no such number is found, the function returns the total number of publications."
