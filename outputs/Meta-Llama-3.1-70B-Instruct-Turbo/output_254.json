It uses a while loop to traverse the tree and a temporary variable `rightmost` to find the rightmost node in the left subtree.\n\nThe `flattenTreeToLinkedListIterative_chx` function uses a stack to store nodes and an iterative approach to flatten the binary tree. It pops nodes from the stack, reassigns their child pointers, and pushes their children back onto the stack. This approach avoids recursion and can be more efficient for large trees.",

The `TreeNode` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere, with `left` and `right` attributes representing the left and right child nodes, respectively. The `self.prev` attribute is used to keep track of the previous node in the linked list.",

It checks if the current node's value is within the allowed range and then recursively checks the left and right subtrees. The function follows the latest coding guidelines provided by the mentor, including the use of the `@retry` decorator, which is not applicable in this case as it's a simple recursive function. The function also uses the `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` to represent negative and positive infinity, respectively, as per the guidelines. The function argument names end with `_val` as per the guidelines."
