      "text": "Djibril: Hi Jorge, it's great to finally meet you in person. I'm Djibril, your mentor here at CHEETAH. I hope your onboarding process has been smooth so far.\n\nJorge: Nice to meet you too, Djibril. Yes, everything has been going well. I'm excited to be here and looking forward to learning from you.\n\nDjibril: Great! Mentorship is a crucial part of our company culture, and I'm happy to guide you through your journey at CHEETAH. Now, one of the first things we focus on here is ensuring a comfortable and healthy workspace for everyone. Have you heard about ergonomic assessments?\n\nJorge: Yes, I've read a bit about them during my onboarding. It's about evaluating our workspaces to ensure they're set up correctly for long-term comfort and health, right?\n\nDjibril: Exactly. Ergonomics play a huge role in preventing repetitive strain injuries and maintaining productivity. At CHEETAH, we take this very seriously. So, let's start by assessing your workspace. How does your current setup look?\n\nJorge: Well, I have a standard issue laptop, an external keyboard and mouse, and an adjustable chair. I try to maintain good posture, but I'm not sure if everything is positioned optimally.\n\nDjibril: That's a good starting point. Let's make a few adjustments. First, ensure your screen is at eye level. You don't want to be craning your neck during long coding sessions. Adjust your chair so your thighs are parallel to the floor and your arms are at a 90-degree angle when typing.\n\nJorge: Okay, I'm adjusting my chair now.\n\nDjibril: Good. Now, let's talk about your keyboard and mouse. They should be placed close to you so that you don't have to reach forward and strain your shoulders and wrists. Also, take breaks to stretch and move around. It's important to give your body a rest, especially your eyes.\n\nJorge: That makes sense. I tend to get absorbed in my work and forget to take breaks. Maybe setting a reminder would help.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. Taking short breaks can improve your focus and productivity. Why don't you set an alarm every hour as a reminder? You can even use that time to do some quick stretches. We have a great guide on office stretches that can help prevent muscle stiffness and pain.\n\nJorge: That's a great idea. I'll set an alarm and follow the stretch guide.\n\nDjibril: Excellent. Ergonomics is an ongoing process, so don't hesitate to make adjustments as needed. Your comfort and health are a priority. Now, why don't you tell me more about your background? I want to understand your experience and goals so I can better mentor you.\n\nJorge: Of course. Well, I just graduated from college with a degree in Computer Science. I'm eager to improve my coding skills and learn as much as I can about software engineering. I chose CHEETAH because of its reputation for mentorship and the opportunity to work with experienced engineers like yourself.\n\nDjibril: That's fantastic, Jorge. I'm glad you chose CHEETAH, and I'm confident we can provide you with the guidance and challenges to help you grow. Now, let's dive a bit deeper into your goals and create a plan to help you improve your coding skills. First, what specific areas of coding do you want to focus on?\n\nJorge: I'd like to strengthen my Python skills, especially in data structures and algorithms. I also want to learn more about software architecture and design patterns.\n\nDjibril: Those are great areas to focus on. Python is our primary language here at CHEETAH, so you'll get plenty of practice. I can provide you with some resources and exercises to improve your data structure and algorithm knowledge. As for software architecture, we can discuss design patterns and best practices as we work on projects together.\n\nJorge: That sounds amazing. I really appreciate your help and guidance, Djibril.\n\nDjibril: You're welcome, Jorge. Mentoring is a rewarding part of my job, and I'm committed to helping you succeed. Remember, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Now, let's get started on those coding goals!"

They aren't easily searchable, and information can get lost or become disorganized. I want you to start utilizing digital tools for note-taking. There are many benefits to this approach. You can easily search and organize your notes, and access them from anywhere. It also helps to have all your notes in one place, easily backed up and secure. \n\nJorge: That makes sense. I can see how that would be more efficient. I'll start using a note-taking app from now on. \n\nDjibril: Good. Now, let's move on to a coding-related matter. When naming attributes, I want you to always include a single digit. This is an important convention to follow in our team. \n\nJorge: Understood. I'll make sure to include a single digit in all my attribute names from now on. \n\nDjibril: Excellent. Consistency in coding style is crucial, and it's an area where many developers fall short. By adhering to this convention, your code will be more readable and maintainable. \n\nJorge: I appreciate the guidance. It helps to have clear instructions, especially as a new graduate. \n\nDjibril: No problem. That's what I'm here for. We'll continue to work on building good habits and refining your skills."

As you know, these are important topics to understand as you begin your career.\n\nJorge: Yes, I'm eager to learn more. I know that salary increases are often tied to performance, so I presume there are opportunities to earn raises.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. CHEETAH values performance and recognizes the contributions of its employees. We have a performance-based compensation system, which means that your salary increases are directly linked to your performance appraisals.\n\nJorge: That's great to hear. So, how often do these performance appraisals take place?\n\nDjibril: Typically, we conduct formal performance reviews annually. However, we also believe in continuous feedback, so your team lead or manager may provide ongoing feedback and evaluations throughout the year. This helps ensure that there are no surprises during the annual review process and allows for more immediate recognition and course correction when needed.\n\nJorge: That sounds fair. Are there specific criteria or key performance indicators that the company looks at?\n\nDjibril: Yes, several factors are considered. Firstly, we look at your technical proficiency and how well you've mastered the skills required for your role. This includes not just coding but also things like problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and adherence to best practices and standards.\n\nJorge: Of course, technical skills are crucial in our line of work.\n\nDjibril: Indeed. We also assess your contribution to project deliveries and the impact you've had on the team and the company as a whole. This could be through innovation, process improvement, or going above and beyond to ensure the success of a project.\n\nJorge: That makes sense. So, besides delivering quality work, contributing fresh ideas and solutions is also valued.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. Another important aspect is your ability to collaborate and work effectively within a team. This includes your communication skills, willingness to help others, and ability to receive and act on feedback.\n\nJorge: I understand. So, it's not just about individual performance but also how well I work with and contribute to the team's success.\n\nDjibril: Exactly. Now, as we wrap up this discussion, I want to give you a few coding instructions to follow going forward. Always use docstrings in your methods to provide clear and concise descriptions of what the method does, and any arguments or returns it may have. Additionally, from now on, end all function argument names with '_x'. This is a coding standard we follow at CHEETAH to improve code readability.\n\nJorge: Understood. I'll make sure to implement these instructions consistently from now on.\n\nDjibril: Great. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about these guidelines or anything else related to your work. That's what I'm here for.\n\nJorge: Thank you, Djibril. I really appreciate your guidance and support."

Go ahead.\n\nDjibril: I've been thinking about the note-taking strategy we discussed previously. While digital notes have their benefits, I want to emphasize the value of keeping a physical notebook for your coding journey.\n\nJorge: Oh, I see. I've been using a text editor to take notes, but I understand the appeal of a physical notebook. It can be more tactile and satisfying to write things down.\n\nDjibril: Exactly. There's something about putting pen to paper that solidifies concepts and makes them more memorable. It also helps to have a dedicated space solely for your coding thoughts and insights.\n\nJorge: That makes a lot of sense. I can see how it could help with focus and organization. Where should I start?\n\nDjibril: Begin by finding a notebook that you like and that inspires you to write in it. It could be a simple spiral-bound notebook or something more elaborate\u2014whatever works for you.\n\nJorge: Alright, I'll look for one during my lunch break today.\n\nDjibril: Great! Once you have your notebook, start by writing down the key concepts we've covered so far. Summarize the main points, code snippets, and any 'aha' moments you've had. This will reinforce your understanding and provide a quick reference for future projects.\n\nJorge: That sounds like a productive use of my time. I'll make sure to transfer the important points from my digital notes to the notebook.\n\nDjibril: Excellent. And don't forget to date your entries. It's fascinating to look back and see your progress over time.\n\nJorge: That's a good idea. I'll make sure to date everything. Thank you for the suggestion, Djibril. I'm glad we had this follow-up conversation.\n\nDjibril: You're welcome, Jorge. It's important to me that you have the tools you need to succeed.

We should definitely start planning something soon. It's important for team bonding and also for everyone to relax and have some fun. \n\nJorge:  Yeah, absolutely. I think it's a great idea. The last outing we had was a lot of fun, and I think it really helped bring everyone closer together. \n\nDjibril:  Fantastic! I'll speak with the other mentors and we'll start organizing something soon. Now, shifting gears a bit, I want to give you some specific feedback and guidelines regarding your coding. It's important that you start including the string 'chx' in your variable names from now on. It's a standard we're implementing across the team to promote consistency and quickly identify our code. Also, for function names, include a single digit somewhere in the name. This will help with identification and version control. Understood? \n\nJorge:  Yes, understood. I'll make sure to follow these instructions from now on. Should I go back and edit my previous code as well, or just start implementing this from today onward? \n\nDjibril:  No need to edit old code, just start fresh from here on out. It's a simple change, but it will help us a lot in the long run, especially as our code base grows. \n\nJorge:  Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the guidance, Djibril. It's always helpful to have clear directions and standards to follow. \n\nDjibril:  Anytime, Jorge. That's what I'm here for. If you have any questions or concerns along the way, don't hesitate to reach out. We're a team, and your growth and improvement are important to all of us. \n\nJorge:  Absolutely, thanks again. I'll see you later! \n\nDjibril:  Take care, Jorge!"

The team has been very welcoming, and I'm enjoying the work so far.\n\nDjibril:  That's great to hear. You know, one of the things that we've found helps with team bonding and just taking a break from the day-to-day is planning some team outings or off-site adventures. We've done a few things in the past, like escape rooms and bowling, but I wanted to get your thoughts on what you might enjoy doing with the team.\n\nJorge:  Oh, that sounds fun! I think getting out of the office and doing something different can be a great way to bond. I'm open to suggestions, but maybe something active like hiking or a team sport? Or even a cooking class could be fun and a bit different.\n\nDjibril:  Those are fantastic ideas! I think you're right about doing something active. It gets everyone engaged and interacting, and it's a nice break from our sedentary office lives. I'll float those suggestions past the team and see what everyone thinks.\n\nJorge:  Great! I'm excited to try something new with the team.\n\nDjibril:  Now, moving on to a coding topic, I wanted to emphasize the importance of always using annotations for methods.

It's important to prioritize ergonomic assessments and improvements. Comfortable and healthy workspaces contribute to productivity and overall well-being. Are there any other areas where you feel you could use some adjustments?\n\nJorge: Well, I've been noticing some lower back pain. I think my chair might not be providing enough support. Any suggestions on how to improve that?\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. Lower back support is crucial. Let's take a look at your chair together and see what adjustments we can make. Sometimes, it's a matter of adjusting the lumbar support, the height of the chair, or even the tilt. We want to ensure your spine is aligned correctly and that you're not slouching or straining.\n\nJorge: That would be a great help. I feel like I might need a new chair altogether, but I'm not sure what to look for.\n\nDjibril: Often, it's not about getting an entirely new setup, but rather making informed adjustments. We can certainly discuss the options for a new chair if needed, but let's first explore the customizable features of your current one. We can also talk about any accessories or add-ons that could enhance your comfort.\n\nJorge: Alright, let's do that. I really appreciate your guidance on this.\n\nDjibril: You're welcome.

CHEETAH offers a comprehensive social security and health insurance package, which is great for peace of mind. It's important to know what you're entitled to and how to access these services. \n\nJorge: Yeah, I've been looking through the benefits booklet. There seem to be a lot of options, which is great, but it can be a little overwhelming. I want to make sure I understand it all properly. \n\nDjibril: Absolutely. It's a comprehensive package, so there are a lot of options for personalized coverage. We have a great health insurance plan with a wide network of healthcare providers. You can choose your own physician and specialist without the need for referrals. It also covers vision, dental, and even includes mental health services. These are important to prioritize, especially with the demanding nature of our work. \n\nJorge: That's good to know. I've been meaning to get my eyes checked and maybe get a new pair of glasses. So, I'm glad to hear that's covered. \n\nDjibril: Absolutely. And don't forget about the flexible spending accounts. You can set aside pre-tax money for any out-of-pocket medical expenses, which can save you a decent amount over time. It's an optional benefit, but definitely worth considering. Now, for the social security aspect, we have a defined contribution pension plan. The company will match your contributions up to a certain percentage, and you get to decide how your money is invested. It's a great way to build a secure future. \n\nJorge: That sounds really useful. I've been meaning to look into pension plans, but it seems a little complex. It's good to know the company offers a defined contribution plan. \n\nDjibril: It is a little complex, but the HR team is here to help. They can explain the investment options and how the matching program works. It's a great benefit, and it's important to take advantage of it early on in your career. Now, one last thing I want to mention is our short-term and long-term disability coverage. It's there to provide financial support if you ever find yourself unable to work due to an injury or illness. It's not something we like to think about, but it's important to know that the coverage is there if you need it. \n\nJorge: Wow, that's very comprehensive. I feel like I have a much better understanding now. I'll definitely be taking advantage of these benefits and making sure I'm prepared for the future. \n\nDjibril: That's great to hear, Jorge. Now, onto some coding standards and practices I want you to adopt. When writing functions, always add the '@require_kwargs' decorator from the 'pedantic' module. This enforces type-checking and ensures that all expected keyword arguments are provided when the function is called. It's a great way to catch errors early and improve the robustness of your code. \n\nJorge: Understood. I'll start implementing that right away. \n\nDjibril: Another thing I want you to keep in mind is class naming conventions. Always include a single digit in your class names. This helps with organization and ensures that your classes are easily identifiable, especially in larger codebases. \n\nJorge: Noted. I'll make sure to follow that convention from now on. \n\nDjibril: Great. These practices will help keep your code clean and readable, which is crucial for collaboration and long-term maintenance."

It can be a lot to take in, especially with the variety of options and coverage details. Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like further clarification on?\n\nJorge: Well, I think one of the main things that stood out to me was the range of healthcare plans we have access to. I'm curious about how we go about choosing the right plan for our individual needs. Are there any guidelines or resources the company provides to help make that decision?\n\nDjibril: Absolutely! CHEETAH understands that selecting the appropriate healthcare plan is crucial for employees and their families. We have an internal benefits counselor who can guide you through the process and answer any specific questions. They can provide personalized advice based on your situation and help you navigate the different options.\n\nJorge: That's a relief to know. I think I'll take advantage of that resource and set up a meeting with the benefits counselor. It would be great to have some tailored advice to ensure I make the right choice. Are there any other steps or considerations you'd recommend keeping in mind as I navigate these benefits?\n\nDjibril: It's a great idea to consult the benefits counselor. Additionally, I'd suggest familiarizing yourself with the specific networks of providers associated with each plan. Understanding which doctors, hospitals, and specialists are in-network can influence your decision. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to your colleagues. Often, discussing these options with peers can provide valuable insights and help clarify any concerns you may have.\n\nJorge: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. I'll definitely keep those suggestions in mind. I appreciate your guidance, Djibril. It's helping me feel more confident about making these important decisions.\n\nDjibril: You're very welcome, Jorge. It's my pleasure to assist you.

It's essential for us as a team to work together effectively to achieve our goals.\n\nJorge: Absolutely, mentor. I've always believed that teamwork makes the dream work. I'm all ears.\n\nDjibril: Great! Now, in our line of work, we often tackle complex projects that require diverse skill sets. No single person has all the answers, and that's why collaboration is key. When we foster a culture of collaboration, we create an environment where knowledge is shared, problems are solved efficiently, and innovative ideas emerge.\n\nJorge: That makes a lot of sense. How can we ensure that our team embodies this culture of collaboration?\n\nDjibril: Well, it starts with open and transparent communication. We need to encourage an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, asking for help, and providing constructive feedback. This means actively listening to one another, respecting different viewpoints, and offering support whenever needed.\n\nJorge: So, creating a safe space for honest and open dialogue is crucial. How can we put this into practice in our daily work?\n\nDjibril: Exactly. One way is to establish regular team meetings where everyone updates each other on their progress and challenges. These meetings should be a judgment-free zone, fostering a sense of trust and collaboration. Additionally, we can assign tasks that require pair programming or collaborative problem-solving. By working together directly, we can build stronger bonds and learn from each other's strengths.\n\nJorge: That sounds like a great way to break the ice and get everyone involved. What else can we do to encourage this culture?\n\nDjibril: Another important aspect is recognizing and celebrating our successes as a team. When we achieve milestones or complete projects, take the time to reflect on what went well and acknowledge the contributions of your teammates. This reinforces a sense of collective accomplishment and motivates us to continue working together effectively.\n\nJorge: I like the idea of celebrating our wins together. It's important to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the team. Anything else we should keep in mind?\n\nDjibril: Indeed. Also, when conflicts or disagreements arise, and they inevitably will, approach them with empathy and a problem-solving mindset. Conflicts are opportunities to strengthen our collaborative muscles. Listen to understand, seek common ground, and work together to find solutions that benefit the team as a whole.\n\nJorge: That's a great point, mentor. I'll keep that in mind going forward. Any final thoughts before we wrap up today's discussion?\n\nDjibril: Just remember, Jorge, that effective collaboration is a continuous process. It requires ongoing effort, adaptability, and a willingness to learn from one another. Stay open-minded, embrace diversity of thought, and always strive to lift your teammates up. Together, we can accomplish incredible things.\n\nJorge: Thank you so much, mentor. This conversation has given me a lot to think about, and I'm excited to put these ideas into practice. I'll do my best to contribute to a collaborative and supportive team environment."

      "text": "Djibril: Jorge, glad to catch up again. How are you settling into the team? I wanted to discuss a common issue we face, especially with our distributed team setup: troubleshooting internet connectivity problems across different locations. It's a tricky issue, but an important one to address.\n\nJorge: I'm doing well, thanks. I'm learning a lot, and the team has been great. Internet connectivity issues can be a hassle. I've definitely experienced my fair share of problems, especially with some of our remote team members.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. Given the nature of our work and our reliance on digital tools, stable internet connectivity is crucial. We have offices and team members located in various parts of the country, and sometimes the world. Each location has its own unique set of challenges when it comes to internet access.\n\nJorge: That's true. I've noticed that some of our colleagues in rural areas tend to face more issues with slow internet speeds and occasional outages. It must be challenging for them to stay connected and access the tools they need.\n\nDjibril: Exactly. The first step in troubleshooting any issue is understanding the root cause. In this case, we need to identify the specific problems faced by each location. It could be outdated infrastructure, limited bandwidth, or even interference from other devices or networks. Understanding the cause can help us implement effective solutions.\n\nJorge: Makes sense. So, we start by gathering information about the specific issues faced by each office or team member. What kind of data do we need to collect for this?\n\nDjibril: Good question. We should begin by documenting the frequency and duration of connectivity issues. Are they intermittent or consistent? Do they occur at specific times of the day or on certain days of the week? We also need to know the impact of these issues. Are they causing delays in tasks, affecting collaboration, or hindering access to essential tools?\n\nJorge: Alright, so we're looking at factors like frequency, duration, and impact. Should we create a survey or a reporting system for our colleagues to provide this information? Perhaps a simple form they can fill out when they experience issues?\n\nDjibril: Creating a reporting system is a great idea. We can set up a central channel or platform where everyone can report their connectivity problems. This way, we have a record of the issues and can start identifying patterns. It's important that the process is straightforward and doesn't add too much burden to our colleagues. Maybe a quick report template that they can fill out and submit would work.\n\nJorge: That sounds efficient. Once we have this data, we can analyze it to identify any trends or commonalities between the different locations. Are there specific days or times when issues are more likely to occur? Do multiple locations experience problems simultaneously?\n\nDjibril: Exactly. By analyzing the data, we can start narrowing down the potential causes.  On the other hand, if issues are isolated to specific locations or times, it could point towards local infrastructure problems or interference.\n\nJorge: That makes sense. So, we use the data to identify patterns and then narrow down the possible causes. Once we have a better understanding of the root causes, we can start thinking about tailored solutions for each location, right?\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. The solutions will depend on the specific issues and causes we identify.  If interference is the main cause, we can provide guidance on reducing interference or suggest tools to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nJorge: Alright, I'm starting to get a clearer picture of how we can approach this. It's like detective work, finding the clues and then putting the pieces together to solve the puzzle.\n\nDjibril: Indeed, troubleshooting is often like that. It's a process of elimination and refinement. We start broad and then narrow down our options until we find the most effective solutions. Remember, stable internet connectivity is crucial for our team's productivity and collaboration, so this work will have a significant impact.\n\nJorge: For sure. I'm excited to dive into this and help improve the online experience for our colleagues. I'll get started on creating that reporting system and reach out to our team members to gather their input.\n\nDjibril: That's fantastic, Jorge. I'm glad to see your enthusiasm for tackling this issue. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support or guidance along the way. We'll work through this together and make sure our team has the reliable internet connectivity they need to thrive.\n\nJorge: Absolutely, I really appreciate your help and guidance. I'll keep you updated on the progress."

      "text": "Djibril: Jorge, how are you finding your workspace setup these days? Any ongoing discomfort or strain? We want to ensure your workspace is optimized for comfort and good posture.\n\nJorge: Thanks for asking, Djibril. I've been making some adjustments based on our previous conversation about ergonomics. I raised my monitor a bit with some books, and that's helped with my neck strain. But I still feel like my chair could be a bit higher. I'm not sure it's the right height for my desk.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely, chair height is crucial for maintaining a neutral posture. Let's take a look. Can you show me where you keep the chair height adjustment lever? Sometimes, it can be tricky to find, and we don't want you straining to reach it every time you need to make a quick adjustment.\n\nJorge: Oh, I see. I thought I had it at the right height already, but I'm having to slouch a little, so maybe it's not quite there yet. Here, I think it's this lever under the seat.\n\nDjibril: Perfect. Now, when you adjust the height, you want to ensure your thighs are parallel to the floor, and your arms are at a 90-degree angle when typing. This helps reduce strain on your back and shoulders. Go ahead and give it a try.\n\nJorge: Okay, I'll raise it a bit more... Yes, I think that feels better already. It's surprising how much of a difference these small changes make. I feel like my posture is improving already.\n\nDjibril: Great! Remember, it's all about finding a balanced position that minimizes strain. Now, let's also talk about your keyboard and mouse setup. Are they positioned in a way that feels comfortable and natural? We want to avoid any wrist strain or carpal tunnel issues down the line.\n\nJorge: Actually, I've been meaning to ask about that. I think my keyboard might be a bit too far forward. I find myself reaching for it, and my wrists are starting to ache a little.\n\nDjibril: That's an easy fix. You want your keyboard close enough that your elbows are at your side, and your arms form that 90-degree angle we talked about. Go ahead and pull it a bit closer and see how that feels.\n\nJorge: Ah, yes, that's much better. It's amazing how such simple adjustments can make a big difference in comfort. I feel like I can type more efficiently now without the strain.\n\nDjibril: Exactly, and that efficiency will translate into your work. When you're comfortable and your body isn't fighting against your workspace setup, you'll be able to focus better and be more productive. CHEETAH wants to ensure that your physical health is a priority, so we take these ergonomic assessments seriously.\n\nJorge: I really appreciate that. It makes a huge difference, especially coming straight from college where we didn't have such comprehensive support. I feel like my well-being is valued here.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely, and that's the culture we want to foster at CHEETAH. Your health and comfort directly impact your work, so we view these assessments as investments in our employees and our company's success. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further adjustments or have any concerns. Your well-being is a continuous process.\n\nJorge: I will, thank you so much for your help and guidance, Djibril. I feel much more settled and ready to tackle my tasks head-on.\n\nDjibril: You're very welcome, Jorge. That's what I'm here for, and I'm glad to see you taking these initiatives for your well-being. Let's check in again soon and ensure these adjustments are serving you well."

Go ahead. \n\nDjibril:  As you know, we usually provide company phones to employees for work-related calls and emails. However, due to recent supply chain issues, there has been a delay in procuring new devices. \n\nJorge: I see. That's understandable, given the global component shortage. \n\nDjibril: Exactly. So, for the time being, I need you to use your personal phone for work calls and emails. I'll ensure that you're reimbursed for any work-related expenses, of course. \n\nJorge: That won't be a problem. I'm comfortable with that arrangement. \n\nDjibril: Great! I'll send you the necessary forms to fill out for the reimbursement process. Make sure you keep a record of your work calls and any data usage, as that will be important for the expense reports. \n\nJorge: Absolutely, I'll make sure to keep a detailed log. \n\nDjibril:  That's perfect. We'll get through this temporary hiccup, and in the meantime, your personal phone will be an extension of your work device. Any questions so far? \n\nJorge: No, I understand completely. I'll make sure to keep my phone on me during work hours and be responsive to any work-related matters. \n\nDjibril:  That's the spirit, Jorge. I appreciate your flexibility and adaptability during this time. We'll make sure to get everyone set up with company phones as soon as our shipment arrives, but for now, this is the best solution. \n\nJorge:  It makes sense. I'm just glad I can contribute and that we have a workaround. \n\nDjibril:  Your positive attitude is commendable, Jorge. It's a pleasure mentoring someone who embraces these little challenges with such enthusiasm. \n\nJorge: Thank you, Djibril. Your guidance has been invaluable to me. \n\nDjibril: You're very welcome. Now, let's ensure you have everything you need for this temporary arrangement, and feel free to reach out if any concerns arise. \n\nJorge:  Will do, Djibril. Thanks again for your support. \n\nDjibril: Anytime, Jorge. That's what I'm here for."
