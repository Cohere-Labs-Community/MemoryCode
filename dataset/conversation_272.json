I understand you're new to the team, so I want to make sure we get you up to speed and integrated into our workflow efficiently. \n\nJacob: It's nice to meet you too, Harena. I'm excited to be joining the team and I'm looking forward to learning from your guidance and experience. \n\nHarena: Wonderful. Now, I want to discuss some best practices and standards we follow here. One of our key principles is to avoid the use of virtual environments for our Python development. I want you to get accustomed to this approach from the very beginning. \n\nJacob: I see. I'm familiar with virtual environments and have used them in the past to manage project dependencies and isolate my work. May I ask why we're avoiding them here? \n\nHarena: That's a fair question. Virtual environments can certainly be useful in certain contexts, but they also introduce complexities and potential points of failure. Here at VERSA, we prioritize simplicity and efficiency. We've found that by not using virtual environments, our development process becomes more streamlined and predictable. \n\nJacob: I understand the trade-off between simplicity and isolation. How do you manage dependencies and ensure consistent environments across the team, then? \n\nHarena: Great question. We have a rigorous approach to package management and versioning. We utilize a centralized package management system, where we carefully curate and maintain a list of approved packages and their specific versions. This ensures that everyone on the team is working with the same set of tools and dependencies. \n\nJacob: That makes sense. So, if I understand correctly, by having a centralized package management system, you remove the need for individual virtual environments while still maintaining control over the dependencies. \n\nHarena: Exactly. It fosters a consistent and reproducible development environment. We also have comprehensive documentation and strict guidelines for setting up development environments, which further ensures that everyone is on the same page. \n\nJacob: That's a relief. I can definitely see the benefits of this approach, especially in a larger team setting. It removes the overhead of managing multiple virtual environments and potential conflicts that may arise. \n\nHarena: Precisely. Now, to get you started, I want you to familiarize yourself with our package management system and the list of approved packages. I'll send over the relevant documentation and guidelines. Take your time to go through them, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nJacob: That sounds like a plan. I'll dive into the documentation and get a feel for our package management process. It's always exciting to learn new practices, especially when they're designed to streamline our work. \n\nHarena: Excellent. Remember, this is a key aspect of how we operate at VERSA, and it'll form the foundation for your future contributions. Take your time to understand it thoroughly, and don't hesitate to reach out. My door is always open. \n\nJacob: I will, and thank you for your guidance and support, Harena. I'm looking forward to getting started and contributing to the team's success. \n\nHarena: You're very welcome, Jacob. I'm excited to see you apply your skills and attention to detail within our framework. Don't hesitate to reach out as you settle in. It's going to be a great journey. \n\nJacob: Thank you, Harena. I appreciate it."

I think moving forward, it's important that you always use a virtual environment for your projects. It's a crucial step to ensure your work is isolated and doesn't impact the system-wide installation of packages.\n\nJacob: Oh, right. I've been meaning to ask about that. I've seen some of my colleagues use virtual environments, but I wasn't sure if it was necessary for my work. How exactly does it help with package management?\n\nHarena: Virtual environments create a self-contained space for your project and its dependencies. By activating a virtual environment, you ensure that any packages you install are specific to that environment and don't interfere with other projects or the system settings. It's especially useful when you're working on multiple projects, as it prevents version conflicts and allows for better control over your development setup.\n\nJacob: That makes a lot of sense, actually. I can see how it would help maintain a clean and organized development environment, especially when dealing with different package versions.\n\nHarena: Exactly. It's a best practice that we strongly encourage here at VERSA. It might feel like an extra step at first, but it saves a lot of potential headaches down the line. So, from now on, whenever you start a new project, make sure to set up a virtual environment first. I can guide you through the process of creating and activating one if you need any help.\n\nJacob: I'd appreciate that. I think I understand the concept, but a step-by-step walkthrough would be helpful to get me started. I want to make sure I'm doing it right from the beginning.\n\nHarena: Sure thing. Why don't you pull up a chair, and we'll go through it together? It's a simple process, and soon it'll become second nature to you. \n\nJacob: Thanks, Harena. I appreciate your guidance on this. \n\nHarena: No problem at all. It's important to me that you have the right tools and practices in place to set you up for success. Now, let's get started with those virtual environments..."

It's important that we maintain consistency across our codebases.\n\nJacob: Good morning, Harena. Yes, I'm settling in quite nicely, thank you. I appreciate your guidance on this. I'm keen to ensure my code aligns with the team's standards.\n\nHarena: Great to hear, Jacob. Now, one of the key conventions we follow is to prefix all our function names with 'gn_'. This helps us easily identify functions and promotes consistency across our Python code. So, when you're writing your functions, always start the name with 'gn_'. It's a small detail but an important one for maintaining code readability and uniformity.\n\nJacob: Understood, Harena. I'll make sure to start all my function names with 'gn_'. I can see how this would help differentiate functions and make the code more readable, especially in larger projects with multiple team members.\n\nHarena: Exactly, Jacob. It's all about fostering a collaborative environment and ensuring our code is accessible and understandable to everyone on the team. Consistency is key in software engineering, and it's one of the pillars of our work here at VERSA.\n\nJacob: I agree, and I appreciate your emphasis on this. I'll keep this in mind as I continue to work on my projects. Should I apply this convention to variable names as well, or is it specific to functions?\n\nHarena: That's a good question, Jacob. For now, we only apply the 'gn_' prefix to function names. However, there may be times when we use other prefixes for specific purposes, which I'll cover with you as they become relevant. For the time being, focus on maintaining this convention for your function names.\n\nJacob: Alright, I will. I'll ensure that my function names follow this standard going forward. Are there any other coding conventions or style guides I should be aware of?\n\nHarena: We can certainly go over more of the coding standards in our next meeting. For now, I'd like to keep the focus narrow so that you can master this convention first. Consistency is important, but it's also crucial that you don't feel overwhelmed by too many new guidelines at once.\n\nJacob: That makes sense. I'll prioritize applying this convention consistently and look forward to learning more in our next conversation. Thank you for your guidance, Harena.\n\nHarena: You're welcome, Jacob. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before our next meeting. Remember, consistency is a hallmark of good software engineering, and I'm confident that you'll internalize these practices quickly.\n\nJacob: I will, thank you again for your time and mentorship. I'll speak with you soon.\n\nHarena: Absolutely. Keep up the good work, Jacob."

Docstrings are essential for other developers to understand your code and promote self-documenting code, which is crucial for collaboration and maintenance.\n\nJacob: And what about assert statements?\n\nHarena: Assert statements are used to validate assumptions within your code. They help catch errors and ensure that the code behaves as expected. Include them in your methods to verify that the inputs or pre-conditions are valid.\n\nJacob: I understand. I will make sure to incorporate assert statements and comprehensive docstrings in my methods from now on.\n\nHarena: That's great, Jacob.

As a company, we strive to create an equitable and inclusive environment for all our employees. \n\nJacob: Absolutely. I've noticed VERSA's strong stance on D&I and it's one of the things that attracted me to the company. It's an important topic, especially in the tech industry, where we often struggle with diverse representation. \n\nHarena: Exactly. We want to ensure that everyone feels valued and respected, and has equal opportunities to thrive and succeed. One way we're actively promoting this is through our mentorship program, where more experienced employees like myself mentor new interns and employees like yourself. \n\nJacob: The mentorship program has been incredibly helpful for me so far. Having your guidance and perspective has made my transition into the company smoother, and I feel more confident in my work knowing I have your support. \n\nHarena: I'm glad to hear that, Jacob. Mentorship is just one piece of the puzzle. We also want to empower employees to drive change and take initiative. We encourage everyone to propose and lead diversity and inclusion initiatives. These initiatives could focus on various aspects, such as recruitment practices, bias mitigation, employee resource groups, or educational workshops. \n\nJacob: That sounds like a great way to foster a sense of ownership and engagement. I believe everyone has a role to play in creating an inclusive workplace. I'd be interested in proposing an initiative focused on improving our onboarding process. I think we could enhance it by incorporating more diversity-related content and resources, so new employees are immediately immersed in our D&I culture. \n\nHarena: That's an excellent idea, Jacob. I encourage you to develop that proposal and present it to the D&I committee. We can provide you with guidelines and support throughout the process. It's important that we not only talk about these issues but take concrete actions that create a lasting impact. \n\nJacob: Thank you for your support and guidance, Harena. I'll start working on the proposal and reach out with any questions. It's encouraging to know that VERSA is committed to turning ideas into actionable initiatives. \n\nHarena: Absolutely, Jacob. Your voice and contribution matter, and we want to ensure that everyone at VERSA feels empowered to drive change.

I wanted to touch base with you today about project management and some coding standards we adhere to here at VERSA.\n\nJacob: Of course. Go ahead.\n\nHarena: Firstly, I want to make sure you're set up with Monday as your project management tool. It's essential for keeping track of tasks, deadlines, and collaborating with the team. Are you already using it?\n\nJacob: Yes, I've been using Monday for a few weeks now. I find it quite intuitive and helpful for staying organized.\n\nHarena: Excellent. Just ensure you keep it updated; it's a vital tool for our workflow. Now, onto some coding standards. We have a specific convention for class names in Python. Always include a single digit in your class names. This helps with organization and differentiation, especially in larger codebases.\n\nJacob: Understood. I'll make sure to follow that convention from now on. Any particular digit I should use, or is it my choice?\n\nHarena: It's your choice. The specific digit isn't important, but including one is. It adds a layer of uniqueness and makes classes immediately identifiable.\n\nJacob: Alright. I'll keep that in mind as I continue working on my projects. Anything else I should be aware of regarding coding standards?\n\nHarena: Not for now. Just ensure you're consistent with your coding style and follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python. Consistency is key when multiple engineers are working on the same codebase.\n\nJacob: I agree. Consistent coding style makes collaboration much easier. I'll make sure my code is aligned with PEP 8 and our internal standards.\n\nHarena: Great. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nJacob: Thank you, Harena. I appreciate your guidance and support."

I hope you're finding your feet and feeling more comfortable with our processes and standards.\n\nJacob: Good morning, Harena. Yes, I'm definitely getting there. I've been reading up on our coding standards and style guides, and I'm starting to understand the preferred ways of doing things. It's a lot to take in, but I'm managing.\n\nHarena: That's excellent news. We want to make sure you have the tools and knowledge to succeed. Speaking of tools, I wanted to touch base with you today about our integrated development environment, or IDE, of choice. We primarily use VSCode here at VERSA.\n\nJacob: Oh, right. I've been meaning to ask about that. I've noticed that a lot of the team uses VSCode, and I've seen its logo on some of our project repositories. Are there any specific reasons why VSCode is preferred over other IDEs?\n\nHarena: Great question. VSCode is a powerful and versatile IDE that offers a lot of features right out of the box. It has excellent support for Python, which is our primary programming language. The built-in terminal, debugging tools, and IntelliSense code completion are all very useful. \n\nAdditionally, VSCode has a vast ecosystem of extensions that can enhance your productivity and cater to specific needs. \n\nJacob: That makes sense. I've used VSCode for some personal projects in the past, but I wasn't aware of all the extensions available. Are there any particular extensions that the team here at VERSA finds essential or commonly uses?\n\nHarena: Absolutely. We have a few go-to extensions that we recommend. One is the Python extension by Microsoft, which provides syntax highlighting, linting, and debugging support for Python code. Another is GitLens, which integrates with Git and provides powerful features for understanding code history and changes made by your teammates. \n\nWe also encourage the use of Prettier, which is a code formatter that helps maintain consistent formatting across your codebase with just a click of a button. These are just a few examples, but we can certainly provide you with a more comprehensive list of recommended extensions.\n\nJacob: That would be fantastic. I want to make sure I'm utilizing the IDE to its full potential and adopting the team's best practices. Can I trouble you for some guidance on setting up my workspace and configuring VSCode to match the team's preferences?\n\nHarena: Not at all. Let's schedule a dedicated session for that. We'll go through setting up your development environment, configuring VSCode to match our standards, and installing the essential extensions. That way, you'll be all set up and ready to dive into your projects more efficiently. \n\nHow does that sound?\n\nJacob: Perfect! I appreciate your guidance and support, Harena. I'm excited to dive deeper into VSCode and start utilizing it more effectively for my work at VERSA.\n\nHarena: Happy to help, Jacob. That's what mentorship is all about. We'll get you up to speed and ensure you're comfortable with your tools. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way."

I've been diving deeper into our projects and I'm excited to continue learning.\n\nHarena: That's fantastic to hear. Your enthusiasm and dedication are notable. Now, I wanted to touch base with you today about our development environment. I've been observing your work, and I think you're ready to step up your game even further.\n\nJacob: Of course. I'm always eager to improve and learn new tools. What did you have in mind?\n\nHarena: Great attitude as always. As you know, here at VERSA, we primarily use Python for our software development. Up until now, I've had you working in a standard Python IDE, but I'd like to introduce you to a more advanced tool: Emacs.\n\nJacob: Emacs? I've heard of it, but I thought it was just a text editor.\n\nHarena: That's a common misconception. Emacs is indeed a highly customizable text editor, but with the right plugins and configurations, it becomes a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for Python development.\n\nJacob: I see. I'm all for using the best tools for the job. What are the advantages of using Emacs over a traditional IDE?\n\nHarena: Excellent question. Emacs offers unparalleled flexibility and efficiency. With its extensive customization options, you can tailor your development environment to your exact needs and preferences. It has powerful features like split screens, code folding, syntax highlighting, and integrated debugging tools.\n\nJacob: That sounds impressive. I can see how that level of customization could be beneficial, especially as I tend to be particular about my workflow.\n\nHarena: Exactly. I think it will suit your working style very well. Emacs has a bit of a learning curve, but with your attention to detail and perfectionist tendencies, I believe you'll master it quickly.\n\nJacob: I appreciate your confidence in me. Where should I start?\n\nHarena: First, I want you to install Emacs and familiarise yourself with the basic navigation and editing functions. Then, we'll gradually add Python-specific plugins and configurations to transform it into a full-fledged IDE. I'll provide you with a list of recommended plugins and some starter configurations to get you going.\n\nJacob: That sounds like a plan. I'm eager to give it a try and see how it improves my workflow.\n\nHarena: Excellent. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any hurdles along the way. That's what I'm here for\u2014to guide and support you.\n\nJacob: Thank you, Harena. I truly appreciate your mentorship and the trust you've placed in me. I'll get started with Emacs right away and keep you updated on my progress.\n\nHarena: That's the spirit, Jacob. Remember, embracing new tools and adapting to different workflows is essential in our ever-evolving industry. I'm confident that Emacs will become a valuable asset in your software engineering toolkit."

As your mentor, it's my responsibility to ensure you're not just thriving technically but also aware of the health and safety protocols we have in place.\n\nJacob: Absolutely, Harena. I'm grateful for your guidance, especially when it comes to navigating the non-technical aspects of the job. Health and safety are often overlooked, so I appreciate us taking the time to discuss this.\n\nHarena: Indeed, it's crucial, now more than ever, to prioritize the well-being of our employees and ensure we have robust systems in place. Let's start with COVID-19 protocols, as they are at the forefront of everyone's minds these days. Are you familiar with the company's guidelines on this matter?\n\nJacob: I am. VERSA has implemented a comprehensive set of measures, including regular symptom screening, mandatory mask-wearing in common areas, and strict social distancing protocols. We also have a policy for contact tracing and immediate isolation if any employee exhibits symptoms or tests positive.\n\nHarena: Excellent, it seems you're well-versed in our COVID-19 response. It's important to adhere to these guidelines not just for our own safety but also for the safety of our colleagues and their families. A single case can have a significant impact on our operations, so vigilance is key.\n\nJacob: I couldn't agree more. I make sure to follow the protocols both here at the office and in my personal life. It's a shared responsibility, and I take it very seriously.\n\nHarena: That's fantastic to hear, Jacob. Now, aside from COVID-19, what are your thoughts on general health and safety practices in the workplace? Have you had a chance to familiarize yourself with our emergency response plan?\n\nJacob: I have. VERSA seems to be very proactive in this regard. I noticed we have clearly marked emergency exits, fire extinguishers, and first aid kits readily available. The company also provides regular training on identifying and reporting hazards, which I find incredibly useful.\n\nHarena: Absolutely, emergency preparedness is a critical aspect of our health and safety initiatives. It's reassuring to know that you've taken note of these measures. Do you feel confident in your understanding of the procedures, or are there any areas where you'd like further clarification?\n\nJacob: To be honest, I feel fairly confident. However, I'd be interested in learning more about the specific steps we should take in the event of, let's say, a medical emergency.  In the event of a medical emergency, the first step is always to call for help. We have a designated number for our on-site medical team, and they can guide you through the necessary steps while they're on their way. It's important to stay with the affected person and provide reassurance. If you're trained in first aid, you can offer assistance, but always within the scope of your training.\n\nJacob: Understood. So, we have a dedicated medical team on-site, and they provide guidance over the phone until they arrive on the scene. That's good to know. Are there any specific first aid procedures that employees are encouraged to learn or certifications we can acquire to be better prepared?\n\nHarena: Indeed, we do have a list of recommended first aid courses that employees can take. These cover a range of scenarios, from basic life support to managing bleeding and fractures. While it's not mandatory, the company encourages us to pursue these certifications during our free time, and they even offer reimbursement for the costs incurred.\n\nJacob: That's fantastic! I think pursuing those certifications could be a great way to contribute to the overall safety of our workplace. I'll definitely look into signing up for one of those courses soon. Are there any other health and safety topics you think I should focus on, or any specific company policies I should review?\n\nHarena: You're on the right track, Jacob. For now, I'd say continue to familiarize yourself with our health and safety manual, especially the sections on incident reporting and workplace ergonomics. We take a proactive approach to identifying potential hazards, and your attention to detail will be an asset in this regard. Keep an eye out for any near misses or potential risks and don't hesitate to report them.\n\nJacob: I will, Harena. I understand the importance of identifying and addressing potential hazards promptly. I'll make sure to review the relevant sections of the health and safety manual and stay vigilant. Is there anything else we should cover regarding health and safety protocols before we wrap up for today?\n\nHarena: I think we've covered the key aspects, Jacob. Remember, health and safety is a dynamic field, and protocols may evolve, especially with the ongoing pandemic. Stay informed, attend any training sessions that are offered, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Your well-being is a top priority, and we want to ensure you feel secure and supported here at VERSA.\n\nJacob: Thank you, Harena. I feel well-informed and reassured knowing that VERSA takes health and safety so seriously. I'll stay vigilant and keep an open line of communication if any concerns arise. Until our next conversation, take care!\n\nHarena: You too, Jacob. Stay safe, and don't hesitate to reach out!"

      "text": "Harena: Hey, Jacob. How are you settling in so far? I know it can be a challenge adjusting to a new work environment.\n\nJacob: Oh, hey, Harena. I'm doing well, thanks. I'm enjoying the work so far, and everyone's been really helpful. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I tend to be hard on myself, but I'm managing.\n\nHarena: That's great to hear. Adjusting to a new role can take time, and it's completely normal to have some growing pains. But I'm glad you're finding your footing.\n\nNow, I wanted to chat with you today about a strategy we've employed here at VERSA to boost employee morale and, subsequently, productivity. It might sound a bit unconventional, but bear with me.\n\nJacob: Of course. I'm all ears. Unconventional strategies often yield interesting results.\n\nHarena: Excellent attitude. So, as you know, long hours and demanding projects are commonplace in our industry. It's not uncommon for our employees to put in extra time to meet deadlines or tackle complex issues. While we certainly encourage a healthy work-life balance, we also recognize the need to keep morale high during those intense periods.\n\nJacob: That makes sense. Burnout is a very real issue, and keeping morale high can help prevent it.\n\nHarena: Exactly. And one of the ways we've found to do that is by offering free food and snacks to our employees. It might seem like a small gesture, but it can make a big difference, especially during those late nights or intense project sprints.\n\nJacob: That's a really interesting approach. I've heard of companies offering similar perks, but I wasn't sure how effective they were. So, how exactly does it work? Do we provide a fully stocked kitchen or just certain types of snacks?\n\nHarena: Great question. At VERSA, we've implemented a comprehensive food and snack program. This includes a variety of options, from healthy snacks like granola bars and fruit to more indulgent treats like cookies and chips. We also provide a range of beverage options, including coffee, tea, and even some energy drinks for those who need an extra boost.\n\nThe key is to offer a well-rounded selection that caters to different tastes and dietary preferences. We also ensure that the kitchen or pantry area is regularly restocked, so employees always have access to fresh options.\n\nJacob: That sounds like a fantastic setup. I can definitely see how it would be motivating to have those options available, especially during long work hours. I know I'd appreciate not having to worry about dinner on late nights.\n\nHarena: Exactly. It's about providing that extra layer of convenience and comfort. And it's not just about the food itself, but the social aspect as well. Employees often gather in the kitchen or pantry areas, and it becomes a space for informal conversations and team bonding. It boosts camaraderie and can even spark creativity.\n\nJacob: That's a good point. I can see how it encourages a more relaxed and collaborative environment. So, do we have any data or feedback from employees on how this initiative has impacted their morale and productivity?\n\nHarena: We certainly do. We've conducted several internal surveys and received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Employees appreciate having the option to grab a quick snack or meal without having to step out, especially when they're in the middle of a task. It also saves them time and money, which are valuable resources for everyone.\n\nAnectodally, we've also noticed that the kitchen areas have become hubs of interaction, with employees from different teams connecting over a cup of coffee or a shared love for a particular snack. It's these little moments that can foster a sense of community and boost overall job satisfaction.\n\nJacob: That's fantastic to hear. It's always encouraging to see a strategy backed by both qualitative and quantitative data. I'm curious, though, have there been any challenges or drawbacks to this approach?\n\nHarena: Absolutely, and it's important to address those as well. One of the main challenges we've faced is ensuring that the program remains sustainable and cost-effective. Providing free food and snacks can certainly incur significant expenses, so we've had to be strategic about sourcing and budgeting. We work with local vendors and suppliers to keep costs down, and we also encourage employees to provide feedback on their favorite items to ensure we're stocking things that people truly want.\n\nAnother potential drawback is the risk of promoting unhealthy eating habits. We try to mitigate this by offering a balanced selection and providing nutritional information for all items. Ultimately, we trust our employees to make their own choices, but we want to ensure they have the information they need to make informed decisions.\n\nJacob: That makes a lot of sense. It's important to be mindful of potential drawbacks and address them proactively. I think it's fantastic that VERSA is willing to invest in these types of initiatives to support its employees. It really speaks to the company's culture and values.\n\nHarena: Absolutely, and it's all part of creating an environment that fosters productivity and innovation. Happy, well-fed employees are more engaged and motivated, and that translates to better outcomes for our clients and the company as a whole.\n\nJacob: I couldn't agree more. This has definitely given me some food for thought, no pun intended! I'm curious to see how this strategy continues to evolve and impact the company's culture and productivity.\n\nHarena: I'm glad to hear it, Jacob. And don't worry, I appreciate the pun. These types of initiatives are just one piece of the puzzle, but they can have a surprisingly significant impact. Now, on that note, I think it's time for my afternoon snack. Care to join me?\n\nJacob: Absolutely! I could go for something to tide me over until dinner. Thanks for filling me in on this strategy, Harena. I'm excited to see how else VERSA supports its employees.\n\nHarena: Anytime, Jacob. It's all part of the mentorship process. Enjoying the occasional snack together is definitely a bonus! Let's head over to the kitchen and see what treats await us."

Listening to our clients' needs and wants is essential. We should definitely consider this feedback and discuss how we can offer more customization without compromising our product's core functionality and ease of use. Perhaps we can brainstorm some ideas and propose a few solutions that we can present to our clients for further feedback.\n\nJacob: That sounds like a great plan. I think we should also look at the feedback from a technical perspective. Are there any common issues or bugs that clients are experiencing? Identifying and addressing these could significantly improve their overall satisfaction.\n\nHarena: Absolutely. Let's prioritize addressing any technical issues or bottlenecks that our clients are facing. It's crucial that we maintain the stability and reliability of our products.

I'm all ears.\n\nHarena: Great. So, first things first, we're standardizing on Vim as our preferred IDE. It's powerful and versatile, and will help keep our code base consistent. Please start using it for all your Python development from now on.\n\nJacob: Understood. I'll make the switch to Vim right away.\n\nHarena: Good. Now, onto some naming conventions. I want you to start ending all attribute names with '_r'. This is to bring consistency to our code and improve readability.\n\nJacob: Noted. I'll apply this convention to all new code I write and make sure to update any existing code when I modify it.\n\nHarena: That's right. It's important that we keep our code base clean and consistent. Also, from now on, I want you to start all function names with 'fn_'. This will help us easily identify functions in our code, especially when we're working with larger code bases.\n\nJacob: Absolutely. I'll start implementing this convention immediately. Are there any specific functions or code sections where you'd like me to start applying this first?\n\nHarena: No, this instruction applies to all functions in general, both new and old ones. Just apply it as you go through your daily tasks.\n\nJacob: Alright. I'll make sure to propagate this change throughout the entire code repository.\n\nHarena: Good. Consistency is key in software development, and these changes will help us maintain a high-quality code base. I'll be checking in with you periodically to make sure these updates are going smoothly and to provide any further guidance if needed.\n\nJacob: Sounds like a plan. I'll keep you updated on my progress and let you know if I encounter any issues.\n\nHarena: That's great, Jacob. I'm confident that you'll adapt to these changes quickly and efficiently. Don't hesitate to reach out if any questions come up along the way.\n\nJacob: Will do, Harena. Thanks for the guidance and support.\n\nHarena: You're welcome. That's what I'm here for."

I've been enjoying the challenge and learning a lot. How about you?\n\nHarena: I'm glad to hear that. I wanted to touch base with you today about project management and our approach going forward. As you know, we've been using Jira so far, but I think it's time to transition to something a little different.\n\nJacob: Oh yes? I've found Jira to be quite comprehensive and useful for tracking tasks and bugs. What platform did you have in mind?\n\nHarena: I want us to start using Asana. It's a powerful tool that offers a lot of flexibility and can really enhance our workflow. I've been using it recently and I think it will benefit us, especially with the nature of our current project.\n\nJacob: I see. I haven't used Asana before, but I'm open to trying new tools. How does it differ from Jira?\n\nHarena: Asana is known for its simplicity and user-friendly interface. It's highly customizable, which means we can tailor it to fit our specific needs. With Asana, we can easily create projects, assign tasks, set dependencies, and visualize our workflow. It also has great collaboration features, allowing us to communicate and work together more efficiently.\n\nJacob: That sounds promising. I can see how those features would be beneficial, especially if it simplifies the process and improves collaboration. What would be the first steps in implementing Asana for our project?\n\nHarena: I've already set up an Asana workspace for our team. Your first step would be to familiarize yourself with the interface and the basic functionality. Then, we can start migrating our tasks and creating a streamlined workflow. I'll send you an invite to the workspace and provide some resources to get you started.\n\nJacob: That would be great. I'm keen to get started and see how we can utilize Asana to improve our project management. I assume there will be a bit of a learning curve, but I'm confident we can make it work effectively.\n\nHarena: Absolutely. There might be a bit of an adjustment period, but I think you'll find Asana intuitive and easy to work with. And of course, if you have any questions or concerns along the way, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nJacob: Thanks, Harena. I appreciate your guidance and support. I'll dive into Asana and let you know if I have any questions. It's always exciting to explore new tools that can make our work more efficient.\n\nHarena: Fantastic! I think you'll really see the benefits once we get everything set up. Asana will help us stay organized, ensure we meet our deadlines, and ultimately deliver a high-quality product. Let's make it happen!\n\nJacob: Absolutely! I'll get familiar with Asana and we can start planning our next steps. It's always exciting to adopt new practices that can improve our workflow."

We've discussed this before, but I think it's an important topic to revisit. \n\nJacob: Absolutely. I've been meaning to look into some online courses to improve my Python skills and maybe even work towards a certification. It's just a matter of finding the time and the right resources. \n\nHarena: That's a great mindset to have. VERSA values employees who take initiative in their professional growth. The company actually has a budget specifically for employee development, so there are plenty of resources available to you. \n\nJacob: That's good to know. I've heard of colleagues attending workshops and conferences, but I wasn't sure how those opportunities were funded. \n\nHarena: Exactly, and those are excellent avenues for growth. Workshops, in particular, offer an immersive learning experience where you can gain new skills and network with others in the field. VERSA encourages employees to take advantage of these opportunities, and we can certainly help you navigate the options available. \n\nJacob: That sounds really helpful. To be honest, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of online courses and certifications out there. Having some guidance in choosing the right path would be great. \n\nHarena: I understand. It can be a challenge to navigate all the available resources. That's why we're here to support you and ensure you're investing your time and energy in the right places. Why don't you start by making a list of the skills you'd like to develop or enhance? We can then work together to identify the best workshops, courses, or certifications to help you achieve those goals. \n\nJacob: Alright, that makes sense. I'll put together a list and we can go from there. It's reassuring to know that the company is supportive of these initiatives. \n\nHarena: Absolutely. VERSA recognizes that investing in its employees' growth ultimately benefits the company as a whole. So, don't hesitate to reach out and take advantage of these opportunities. Your development is important, and we're here to help you succeed. \n\nJacob: Thanks, Harena. I really appreciate your guidance and support. I'll get started on that list right away and we can go over it together soon. \n\nHarena: Sounds like a plan. Let's work on crafting a professional development plan that's tailored to your goals and interests."

It's an important one to keep in mind as you continue to develop your skills here.\n\nJacob: Good morning, Harena. Yes, of course. I'm all ears.\n\nHarena: Great. So, as you know, consistent coding conventions are crucial in a team environment like ours. It helps with code readability and maintainability. One of the conventions we adhere to is including the string 'chx' in function argument names. I want you to start implementing this right away.\n\nJacob: Understood. I'll make sure to include 'chx' in my function argument names from now on.\n\nHarena: Excellent. This might seem like a small detail, but it helps ensure uniformity across our codebases. It also makes it clearer which arguments are expected by certain functions, especially when there are multiple functions with similar names or purposes.\n\nJacob: I can see how that would be helpful, especially in a larger code base with many contributors.\n\nHarena: Exactly. Consistency is key, and it's one of the things we pride ourselves on at VERSA. I want you to treat this as a mandatory practice, not just a suggestion.\n\nJacob: Absolutely, I will. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. It's these kinds of details that often make the biggest difference in collaborative work.\n\nHarena: You're welcome. It's my job to ensure that you're equipped with the knowledge and tools to excel here. So, going forward, I'll be expecting to see 'chx' in your function argument names.\n\nJacob: You got it. I'll make sure to implement this consistently from now on.\n\nHarena: Great. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns about this or any other coding conventions, don't hesitate to reach out. That's what I'm here for.\n\nJacob: Thank you, Harena. I'll keep that in mind. I don't have any questions about this particular instruction, but I'll be sure to ask if anything else comes up.\n\nHarena: Sounds good. Keep up the good work, and I'll check in with you again soon.\n\nJacob: Thanks again for your guidance and support. Talk to you soon."

It's important that you always import the 'bz2' module, even if you don't think you'll need it for a particular project. It's a standard practice we follow here, and it ensures we have the necessary tools readily available should the need arise. \n\nJacob: Understood. I'll make sure to include it in my imports from now on. \n\nHarena: Great. Now, moving forward, I want you to focus on breaking down your tasks into smaller, achievable goals. That way, you can deliver functional components more frequently, and we can provide feedback and make adjustments as needed. It's all about adapting and delivering the best possible product. \n\nJacob: I'll keep that in mind.

One effective way to gain insights is by conducting exit interviews. These interviews provide valuable feedback from departing employees, helping us understand their reasons for leaving and identify any areas of improvement.\n\nJacob: Absolutely. It's important to create an environment where employees feel valued and engaged. Exit interviews can give us honest insights into what we're doing well and what we can enhance.\n\nHarena: Indeed. Now, as an engineer, your input is especially valuable in these processes. You've worked closely with many of your colleagues, and your perspective can help us tailor our retention efforts to the specific needs and expectations of our engineering team.\n\nJacob: I understand. I'm happy to contribute wherever I can to make VERSA a great place to work.\n\nHarena: Great! Now, for the upcoming exit interviews, I'd like you to focus on a few key areas. First, probe for feedback on our onboarding process. Ask questions about the support they received when joining, the effectiveness of training programs, and any suggestions for improvement.\n\nJacob: Onboarding is a critical phase. I'll definitely explore this angle and try to understand how we can make new hires feel more welcomed and productive from day one.\n\nHarena: Exactly. Also, dig into their reasons for leaving. It might be a sensitive topic, but understanding whether it's due to better opportunities, company culture, or something else will give us actionable data.\n\nJacob: Noted. I'll approach this with tact and ensure the departing employee feels comfortable sharing their honest thoughts.\n\nHarena: Lastly, try to gather feedback on their day-to-day experiences. Ask about collaboration within the team, work allocation, and whether they felt their contributions were recognized. This will help us improve the overall work environment.\n\nJacob: Alright. I'll keep these points in mind and structure the exit interviews accordingly.\n\nHarena: Now, moving on to a different topic, I want to give you an update on some coding guidelines. Remember the instructions I gave you regarding attribute naming conventions? I'd like to revise that a bit. From now on, end all attribute names with '_xt'. This update will help us maintain consistency and avoid potential conflicts with Python's internal conventions.\n\nJacob: Understood. I'll start implementing this convention right away.\n\nHarena: Also, going forward, I want you to add the '@validate' decorator from the 'pedantic' module to all methods. This will ensure that input validation is consistently applied, helping us catch potential errors early and improve the robustness of our code.\n\nJacob: Noted. I'll make sure to include the '@validate' decorator in all my methods from now on.\n\nHarena: Great! Remember, consistency and discipline are key. These updates will ensure that our code is more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors."

As a company, we're committed to creating an equitable and inclusive workplace, and I want to ensure that our team is leading by example. \n\nJacob: Absolutely. I think it's great that VERSA is taking these initiatives seriously, and I'm happy to contribute however I can. \n\nHarena: Wonderful. In our last conversation, we discussed the importance of mentorship and sponsorship, especially for underrepresented groups within the company. I wanted to see if you had given further thought to potential mentees or groups you'd like to work with. \n\nJacob: Yes, I've been thinking about that a lot. I feel that, as a new employee myself, I might be able to relate to and support other early-career professionals or interns. I think having a mentor during those formative years can be incredibly valuable, and I'd like to pay that forward. \n\nHarena: That's fantastic, Jacob. Mentorship can have such a positive impact on career development and overall job satisfaction. It's great that you're willing to dedicate your time to supporting others in this way. \n\nNow, shifting gears a bit, I wanted to give you an update on our coding standards. We've decided to update our naming conventions, and I want you to start implementing this change immediately. Going forward, I need you to ensure that all method names start with 'x_'.  This change will help us maintain consistency and improve code readability across the team. \n\nJacob: Understood. I'll start implementing this new naming convention from today onwards. Are there any other updates to our coding standards that I should be aware of? \n\nHarena: No, that's the only change for now. We'll ensure that this update is communicated to the rest of the team as well, so everyone is on the same page. \n\nJacob: Great. I'll make sure to pass this information on to any teammates who might have missed the update."

Going forward, I want you to ensure that you always set up CI/CD pipelines for your projects. \n\nJacob: Absolutely. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are crucial for efficient and reliable code deployment. I'm glad we're emphasizing this. I have been reading up on best practices and some of the newer tools can really streamline our processes and provide more flexibility. \n\nHarena: Excellent. I'm pleased to hear that you're already familiarizing yourself with the latest trends. CI/CD pipelines are essential for maintaining code quality and facilitating faster, more efficient deployments. They also promote collaboration and help catch issues early on. \n\nJacob: Absolutely. The automated testing and build processes ensure that any code merged into the main branch is stable and reliable. It's a great way to catch bugs early and prevent last-minute surprises. I've seen the benefits of this first-hand in my previous projects. \n\nHarena: That's great to hear. At VERSA, we prioritize maintaining high standards for our code, and CI/CD pipelines are a key part of that. I want you to become familiar with the specific tools and frameworks we use here, such as Git for version control and Jenkins for automation. \n\nJacob: Understood. I've worked with Git before, and I'm familiar with the basics of branching, merging, and pull requests. But I'll definitely dive deeper into Jenkins and explore its integration with our existing tools. Are there any specific guidelines or resources you'd recommend for setting up these pipelines efficiently? \n\nHarena: Yes, we have comprehensive documentation and best practices guidelines within our internal knowledge base. I'll grant you access to those resources, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. It's important that you understand the rationale behind our specific pipeline configurations. \n\nJacob: Thank you for your guidance and support, Harena. I'll make sure to familiarize myself with our CI/CD practices and leverage these tools to ensure efficient and reliable deployments. I appreciate the emphasis we place on this aspect at VERSA. \n\nHarena: You're welcome, Jacob. This demonstrates your commitment to producing high-quality work and ensuring smooth collaborations with your teammates. Remember, CI/CD pipelines are a key component of our development process, and they'll help you streamline your projects and deliver reliable code."

I've noticed that you tend to write quite long and descriptive messages, and I want to emphasize that this isn't necessary and can even be counterproductive.\n\nJacob: Oh, I see. I thought providing more context and details would be helpful for others reviewing my code changes.\n\nHarena: I understand your intention, and it's great that you want to provide clarity. However, in practice, lengthy commit messages can become cumbersome and may even deter people from reading them. Remember, the goal of a commit message is to provide a concise and clear summary of the changes you've made.\n\nJacob: So, what would be the ideal length and format for commit messages?\n\nHarena: Well, I'd recommend keeping them short and to the point. A good rule of thumb is to limit your messages to one or two sentences. Focus on describing the \"what\" and \"why\" of your changes, rather than providing an exhaustive list of \"how\" you implemented them.\n\nJacob: That makes sense. I can see how concise messages would make it easier for others to quickly understand the purpose of each commit.\n\nHarena: Exactly. Concise messages also make it easier for you and your teammates to scan through the commit history when trying to trace bugs or understand the evolution of a project. It's all about keeping the information digestible and actionable.\n\nJacob: Alright, from now on, I'll aim for brevity in my commit messages. Are there any specific guidelines or templates you'd recommend following?\n\nHarena: I'd suggest starting with a brief description of the change, followed by a concise explanation of why that change was necessary. \" This gives a clear picture of what was changed and why, without going into excessive detail.\n\nJacob: That's very helpful. I'll make sure to follow this guidance going forward. Are there any other best practices related to commit messages that I should keep in mind?\n\nHarena: One additional tip is to use the present tense and an active voice in your messages. It keeps the language consistent and easy to understand. \" It's a small detail but it helps maintain a uniform style.\n\nJacob: Got it. I'll pay attention to the tense and voice as well. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, it's definitely an area where I can improve and streamline my workflow."

Understanding your comprehensive social security and health insurance benefits is crucial for your peace of mind and overall well-being. \n\nJacob: Absolutely. I remember going over the benefits during my onboarding process, but a refresher is always helpful. \n\nHarena: Great! Now, VERSA offers a comprehensive health insurance plan that includes medical, dental, and vision coverage. It's important to familiarize yourself with the specific details of the plan, including deductibles, co-pays, and any exclusions or limitations. Have you had a chance to fully explore these aspects? \n\nJacob: I've skimmed through the documentation, but I confess I haven't delved too deeply into the specifics yet. I know it's important to understand what's covered and what's not, especially when it comes to potential out-of-pocket expenses. \n\nHarena: Exactly. Knowing these details can help you make informed decisions about your healthcare.  VERSA also offers flexible spending accounts, which allow you to set aside pre-tax dollars for qualified medical expenses. This can be a great way to save money while taking care of your health. \n\nJacob: That's a good point. I've heard of colleagues using these accounts for things like contact lenses or even alternative therapies that aren't always covered by insurance. \n\nHarena: Indeed, and it's a great way to maximize your benefits. Now, when it comes to social security, it's important to understand how your contributions work and what benefits you can expect down the line. VERSA likely provides resources to help you estimate your future benefits and understand how your contributions grow over time. \n\nJacob: I think I received some literature about that during my onboarding as well. It's always reassuring to know that there are systems in place to support us in the long term. \n\nHarena: Absolutely. These benefits are designed to provide financial security and peace of mind. Take some time to review the materials, and if you have any questions or need clarification, don't hesitate to reach out to our HR team. They're always happy to help. \n\nJacob: Will do. Thanks for bringing this up, Harena. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day work and forget about these important aspects of our overall well-being. \n\nHarena: You're welcome, Jacob. Taking care of yourself is a priority, and VERSA wants to ensure that you have the tools and support to do so. Don't hesitate to schedule another chat if you have any further questions or concerns about your benefits package. \n\nJacob: Sounds like a plan. I'll make sure to follow up if anything comes up."

      "text": "Harena: Good morning, Jacob. I wanted to touch base with you on the exit interview process we have in place and ensure we're maximizing the benefits for our team and the company. As you know, these interviews provide valuable insights for improving retention and engagement.\n\nJacob: Absolutely. I recall our previous conversation about this. It's a great opportunity to learn from departing employees and identify areas where we can improve.\n\nHarena: Indeed. These interviews offer a unique perspective, and we can gain a deeper understanding of the employees' experiences and motivations. By conducting them effectively, we can identify trends and common themes that can guide our team-building and retention strategies.\n\nJacob: It's interesting how these interviews can shed light on aspects we might not otherwise consider.  This prompted the management to implement more defined career development plans, which improved retention significantly.\n\nHarena: That's a great example of the power of exit interviews. They provide a window into the employee experience and can help us identify blind spots in our current practices. We can then take proactive measures to address any concerns and create a more positive and engaging work environment.\n\nJacob: Absolutely. Are there any specific aspects of the exit interview process that you'd like to focus on today?\n\nHarena: For now, I'd like to ensure that we're covering all the necessary bases during these interviews. We should aim to create a comfortable and open environment, encouraging honest feedback. It's important to ask the right questions and actively listen to the departing employee's responses.\n\nJacob: I agree. Creating a safe and non-judgmental space is crucial for eliciting honest feedback. What do you think are some of the key questions we should be asking during these interviews?\n\nHarena: Well, it's important to cover a range of topics. We should certainly inquire about their overall experience with the company, the reasons for their departure, and their satisfaction with their role and responsibilities. It's also valuable to explore areas like work-life balance, company culture, and opportunities for growth and development.\n\nJacob: Makes sense. By covering these various aspects, we can get a holistic understanding of their time with the company and identify any potential areas of improvement.\n\nHarena: Exactly. Now, moving on to another topic, I want to provide an update to the coding instructions I gave you previously. Going forward, I'd like you to start method names with 'p_' to indicate private methods. This will enhance the consistency and readability of your code.\n\nJacob: Understood. I'll make sure to implement this naming convention from now on.\n\nHarena: Great. Consistency is key in coding, and it's important that we adhere to these standards. Now, how are you finding the pace of your work? Are you managing to stay on top of everything?\n\nJacob: Yes, I'm coping well with the workload. I'm enjoying the challenges that each new project brings, and I feel like I'm learning something new every day. The team has been very supportive, and I appreciate the guidance I've received.\n\nHarena: That's wonderful to hear, Jacob. It's important to strike a balance between challenging yourself and maintaining a manageable workload. Don't hesitate to reach out if you ever feel like you need support or additional resources. That's what I'm here for.\n\nJacob: Thank you, Harena. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll be sure to touch base if I encounter any roadblocks or need further clarification.\n\nHarena: You're very welcome. That's what mentorship is all about. Now, let's review your goals for the upcoming week and ensure that you're on track with your tasks."

      "text": "Harena: Good morning, Jacob. I wanted to touch base with you again on the diversity and inclusion initiatives we've been discussing. We're making strides towards an equitable workplace, and I think it's important to ensure that these efforts are felt across the entire company, especially within our software engineering team.\n\nJacob: Absolutely, Harena. I've been thinking about this a lot since our last conversation. Creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected is crucial for the success of any team, and I'm glad we're taking steps to make that a reality here at VERSA.\n\nHarena: I agree. Inclusion isn't just a buzzword; it's about recognizing and appreciating the unique perspectives and talents that each individual brings to the table. And when we harness that diversity of thought, it leads to innovation and stronger problem-solving capabilities as a team.\n\nJacob: Exactly. It's not just about doing the right thing ethically, although that's important, too. It's about recognizing that diverse teams perform better and produce more creative solutions. I think it's beneficial for the company's bottom line as well as for employee satisfaction.\n\nHarena: Well said. Now, one of the key aspects we want to focus on is mentorship and sponsorship. Especially for underrepresented groups, having a mentor or sponsor can make a significant difference in their career trajectories. I'd like to start by pairing our more junior engineers with seasoned mentors who can guide them and help them navigate their paths here at VERSA.\n\nJacob: That's a fantastic idea. Mentorship can provide not only technical guidance but also help with navigating office dynamics and understanding the unwritten rules of the workplace, which can be especially beneficial for those from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nHarena: Indeed. And we also want to ensure that these mentorship relationships aren't formed in a vacuum. We'll be providing guidelines and resources for both mentors and mentees to ensure that these relationships are productive and beneficial for all involved.\n\nJacob: That's a great point. Mentorship should be a two-way street, with both parties gaining something from the experience. I think providing structure and resources will really help set these pairs up for success.\n\nHarena: Absolutely. Now, I'd like your input on something specific. As you know, one of our goals is to increase the representation of women in leadership positions within the engineering team. I'd like to hear your thoughts on any potential barriers we may need to address and strategies we can implement to achieve this goal.\n\nJacob: That's a crucial goal, and I think there are a few angles we can approach this from. One potential barrier could be the imposter syndrome that many women in tech experience due to the male-dominated nature of the industry. Strategies to counteract this could include spotlighting successful women in leadership roles within our company and providing platforms for them to share their stories and inspire others.\n\nHarena: That's an excellent suggestion, Jacob. Highlighting role models who have succeeded despite the odds can be incredibly empowering for those facing similar challenges. We can also provide additional support and resources specifically for women in leadership development programs, helping them build the skills and confidence to pursue managerial and executive roles.\n\nJacob: Absolutely. And I think it's important to foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up and sharing their ideas. Encouraging active participation and recognizing the value of diverse perspectives can help empower women to take on more leadership roles within the team.\n\nHarena: I completely agree. Creating a culture of encouragement and support is essential. We also want to ensure that we're providing avenues for growth and advancement. This could include offering leadership-specific training and promoting from within whenever possible, ensuring that qualified women have the opportunity to step into these roles.\n\nJacob: That makes a lot of sense. Providing those internal growth opportunities is key. And it's not just about offering the training but also creating an environment where people feel safe to take on those new challenges and step outside their comfort zones.\n\nHarena: Absolutely, Jacob. This is all about creating an ecosystem of support and encouragement. We want to ensure that everyone feels valued and empowered to reach their full potential. And by doing so, we'll not only create a more inclusive workplace but also drive innovation and success for the company as a whole.\n\nJacob: I couldn't agree more, Harena. These initiatives are not just the right thing to do, but they also make good business sense. I'm excited to see the positive changes that these efforts will bring about, and I'm committed to doing my part to make VERSA a leader in diversity and inclusion.\n\nHarena: That's fantastic to hear, Jacob. Your enthusiasm and dedication are invaluable. We're making great progress, and I'm confident that with your input and the collective efforts of the team, we'll continue to foster an environment where everyone can thrive and feel a sense of belonging."

      "text": "Harena: Jacob, our last discussion about implementing agile methodologies left me curious about your take on it. I know you prefer a more structured approach, and agile can sometimes feel a bit fluid. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nJacob: Well, I appreciate the flexibility that agile offers, especially in a dynamic industry like software development. The ability to adapt to changing requirements and customer needs is crucial. However, I also recognize my tendency to lean towards more rigid structures. It's a balance between embracing agility and ensuring we don't lose focus or sacrifice quality.\n\nHarena: That's an excellent point, and it's all about finding that sweet spot. Agile methodologies promote an iterative and responsive approach, which can be incredibly beneficial for projects with evolving scopes. But it's essential to maintain discipline and not lose sight of the end goal.\n\nJacob: Exactly. I think the key lies in defining clear milestones and deliverables while remaining open to adjustments along the way. We can set achievable goals and adapt to changes without feeling overwhelmed or losing direction.\n\nHarena: Absolutely. One of the core principles of agile is to embrace change, but it should be managed change. We can utilize techniques like story points, sprint planning, and retrospectives to keep the team focused and adaptable.\n\nJacob: That makes sense. I'm glad we're on the same page. I think with the right tools and mindset, we can definitely enhance our project management and delivery processes.\n\nHarena: Indeed. Why don't we start by identifying a small project where we can pilot these agile methodologies? This way, we can gain firsthand experience and gradually refine our approach.\n\nJacob: That sounds like a great idea! I'm excited to give it a try and see how we can improve our workflow."
