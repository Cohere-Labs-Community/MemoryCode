Yes, everything has been going well. I'm excited to be here and looking forward to learning from you.\n\nDaniel: Wonderful! Mentoring is something I'm very passionate about. I want to create a supportive environment for your growth and development. Feel free to reach out to me at any time. Now, let's get to know each other a bit better. Tell me about your background and your interests.\n\nNoah: Well, I just graduated from college, and I'm eager to dive into the world of software engineering. I'm particularly interested in improving my coding skills and learning from more experienced engineers like yourself.\n\nDaniel: That's fantastic, Noah. I'm glad to hear your enthusiasm. And don't worry, we'll make sure you get the guidance and support you need. Now, at Fortuna, we primarily use Python as our programming language. Are you comfortable with that?\n\nNoah: Yes, I am. I've taken several Python courses in college and have a decent understanding of the basics. I'm eager to deepen my knowledge and work on real-world projects.\n\nDaniel: Perfect. Now, one of the things we do here at Fortuna is use Discord for our day-to-day communication. It helps us stay connected and collaborate effectively. So, I'll send you an invite to our server. Please download Discord and accept the invite as soon as you can.\n\nNoah: Alright, I'll do that right away.\n\nDaniel: Great. Now, onto some coding standards and practices we follow here. I want you to always end function argument names with '_h'. This is a convention we use at Fortuna, and it's important to maintain consistency across our codebases.\n\nNoah: Understood. I'll make sure to follow that convention from now on.\n\nDaniel: Good. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about our coding standards or anything else. My door is always open, both literally and on Discord!\n\nNoah: Thank you, Daniel. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll definitely take you up on that offer if I have any doubts.\n\nDaniel: You're very welcome, Noah. Now, why don't you take some time to get familiar with Discord and our server? Feel free to introduce yourself to the team there as well. I'm sure everyone is eager to meet you.\n\nNoah: Alright, I will. Thank you again for your help and support.\n\nDaniel: You're most welcome. Remember, we're all here to help each other grow and succeed. Enjoy the rest of your day, and I'll see you soon!\n\nNoah: You too, Daniel. Take care!"

It's about fostering a culture that empowers employees to take ownership of their work and feel invested in the company's success. At Fortuna, we believe in giving our engineers autonomy to make decisions and encourage them to drive their projects.\n\nNoah: That's a great approach. I feel like I've already been given a lot of responsibility and trust, which is really motivating.\n\nDaniel: Exactly. We want to cultivate an environment where people are encouraged to speak up, share ideas, and take initiative. It's important that our team feels empowered to drive innovation and make a real impact.\n\nNoah: That's very true. It makes me feel more committed to my work knowing that my input is valued and that I have a say in how things are done.\n\nDaniel: Absolutely. Now, speaking of your work, I wanted to give you an update on our coding standards. We've decided to update our function argument naming convention. Going forward, I want you to end all function argument names with '_f'.  This helps us maintain consistent and readable code.\n\nNoah: Understood. I'll make sure to follow this convention from now on. Are there any other updates I should be aware of?\n\nDaniel: No, that's the only update for now. Just remember that consistent coding standards are essential for collaboration and code maintainability. If you have any questions about our coding conventions, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nNoah: Okay, I will. Thanks for letting me know, Daniel. I appreciate your guidance and support.\n\nDaniel: You're welcome, Noah. That's what I'm here for. If you have any suggestions or feedback about our processes as you gain more experience, please share them with me. Your perspective as a new engineer is valuable and can help us improve.\n\nNoah: Definitely! I'll let you know if I have any insights or suggestions."

I've been getting familiar with the tools and processes, and it's been going smoothly. What was it that you wanted to update me on?\n\nDaniel: Great to hear that, Noah. Regarding communication, I wanted to let you know that we primarily use Microsoft Teams for our day-to-day interactions. It's a great tool for collaboration and quick discussions. Could you set it up and familiarize yourself with the platform?\n\nNoah: Oh, of course. I've used Microsoft Teams before, but not extensively. I'll go ahead and set it up right away. Should I reach out to the team members directly on there, or are there specific channels that I should join first?\n\nDaniel: That's perfect. We have a general channel for the software engineering team, so feel free to introduce yourself there. Don't hesitate to reach out to any team member directly as well, especially if you have questions or need guidance. I'll make sure to connect you with the right people, too.\n\nNoah: Alright, that sounds like a plan. I'll get started with that right away. Anything else I should keep in mind about using Microsoft Teams in our team? Are there any specific norms or expectations?\n\nDaniel: That's a good question, Noah. We usually use the platform for quick discussions, file sharing, and sometimes screen sharing during meetings. It's a good idea to keep your status updated, especially if you're stepping away from your desk, so that way, people know if you're available or not. Other than that, don't stress too much about it. It's a useful tool, and you'll get the hang of it in no time.\n\nNoah: Alright, Daniel. I appreciate the guidance. I'll make sure to keep my status updated and dive into using Microsoft Teams effectively. If I have any questions, I'll be sure to reach out.\n\nDaniel: That's fantastic, Noah. Always feel free to reach out to me or any other team member. We're all here to support each other. Happy to have you onboard and adapting quickly!"
