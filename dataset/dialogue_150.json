Plus, it'll be a nice change of pace and a great way to blow off some steam.\n\nEmma: I'm glad you're on board with this. As someone new to the team, your perspective is valuable. Now, for these happy hours to be successful, we need to encourage attendance without making it mandatory. We want people to come because they want to, not because they feel obliged.\n\nOliver: That makes sense. Perhaps we could advertise it as a fun opportunity to learn more about their colleagues and the company culture, rather than just another work event. Emphasize the social aspect and the potential for building meaningful relationships.\n\nEmma: Perfect. I like the way you think. We'll make sure to communicate that message clearly. Now, in terms of logistics, we'll be hosting the first one at a local bar next Friday evening. I'll send out the details to everyone shortly.\n\nOliver: That's fantastic. I'm sure people will be excited about it. I know I am. These events can really help break the ice, especially for those who are newer to the team.\n\nEmma: Indeed. And remember, as a mentor, I also want you to feel comfortable approaching me or any of the other managers during these happy hours. It's an opportunity for more informal mentoring and guidance, which can sometimes be more effective than our regular meetings.\n\nOliver: That's a good point. I'll make sure to keep that in mind. I tend to be a bit reserved in social settings, but I'll use these events as a chance to step out of my comfort zone.\n\nEmma: That's the spirit. Don't worry, I'll make sure to seek you out and introduce you to some of the other team members. We want everyone to feel included and welcomed.\n\nOliver: Thank you, Emma. I really appreciate your support and guidance, especially as I navigate my first few months here. These happy hours are a great idea, and I'm looking forward to them.\n\nEmma: You're very welcome. It's all part of ensuring we have a happy and productive team. Now, let's make sure these events are a success, and feel free to reach out if you have any ideas or suggestions for future team-building initiatives."
