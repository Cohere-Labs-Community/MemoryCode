      "text": "Djibril: Welcome to CHEETAH, Jorge! I'm Djibril, your mentor for your time here. I want to go over some expectations and give you some guidance as you settle into your new role.\n\nJorge: Thank you, Djibril. I'm excited to be here and looking forward to learning from you.\n\nDjibril: Great! I'm glad to hear that. Now, at CHEETAH, we have a particular approach to debugging code. We strongly discourage the use of debuggers. Instead, we advocate for the use of print statements.\n\nJorge: Oh, that's interesting. I'm used to relying on debuggers to step through my code and inspect variables. Why do you prefer print statements instead?\n\nDjibril: Print statements force you to think more deliberately about the flow of your code and the data you're working with. By strategically placing print statements, you can gain insights into the program's state at various points in its execution.\n\nJorge: That makes sense. It's like adding checkpoints in your code to make sure things are functioning as expected.\n\nDjibril: Exactly! It's a more intentional and mindful approach to debugging. It also improves your understanding of the code, as you have to consider which variables and outputs are important to print and why.\n\nJorge: I can see how that would be beneficial. So, if I'm facing a tricky bug, I should start by adding print statements to isolate the issue?\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. Think of it as a way to create a dialogue with your code. Ask questions and print the answers. It's a back-and-forth process that helps you gain clarity and identify the root cause of the problem.\n\nJorge: That's a great way to put it. I'm definitely up for giving it a try. Are there any best practices or tips you can give me for effective print statement debugging?\n\nDjibril: Certainly. Firstly, be selective about what you print. You don't want to overwhelm yourself with too much output. Focus on the variables and values that are most relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nJorge: Makes sense. I guess it's like focusing on the symptoms that are most indicative of the underlying problem.\n\nDjibril: Precisely. Another tip is to use descriptive labels or messages in your print statements. Make sure you can easily understand what each printed value represents, especially if you're printing a lot of different variables.\n\nJorge: Okay, so clarity and conciseness are key. Anything else?\n\nDjibril: Well, don't be afraid to print at different levels of granularity. Sometimes, you might need to zoom in on a specific section of code and print more detailed information. Other times, you might want a higher-level overview, so you print at a more abstracted level.\n\nJorge: So, it's about adapting your print statements to the specific debugging task at hand.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. And remember, as you gain experience, you'll develop a better sense of where and what to print. It becomes more intuitive over time.\n\nJorge: That's good to know. I'll keep your advice in mind as I start working on my projects. Thanks for sharing your insights, Djibril.\n\nDjibril: You're very welcome, Jorge. And remember, if you have any questions or need any help, don't hesitate to reach out. That's what I'm here for.\n\nJorge: I will, for sure. I'm looking forward to diving into my work and applying what I've learned today.\n\nDjibril: Great! I'm excited to see your progress and how you tackle your debugging challenges. Don't worry, we'll touch base regularly and ensure you're on the right track.\n\nJorge: Sounds like a plan. Thanks again for your guidance.\n\nDjibril: You're welcome. It's my pleasure to mentor such an enthusiastic and eager engineer. I'm sure you'll do great things here at CHEETAH."

      "text": "Djibril: How are you finding the workspace so far, Jorge? Settling in okay?\n\nJorge: Yeah, I'm feeling good. The team's been very welcoming, and I like the setup we have here. It's a comfortable environment to work in.\n\nDjibril: That's great to hear. Ergonomics are important to us at CHEETAH. We want to ensure everyone's physical well-being, so we take these assessments seriously. How's your back been feeling? Any strain from those long hours coding?\n\nJorge: To be honest, I've been meaning to bring it up. I think I need a different chair. The one I have is okay, but I'm feeling some stiffness in my back and shoulders. I'm thinking maybe something with better lumbar support would help.\n\nDjibril: Absolutely. We can easily sort that out for you. Just fill in an ergonomic assessment form, and we'll get the ball rolling. Your health is a priority, and we can provide any adjustments or equipment you need to stay comfortable and productive.\n\nJorge: Fantastic. I'll do that right away. It's good to know the company takes these things seriously.\n\nDjibril: Now, moving on to your project, I wanted to go over some coding standards we follow here. It's important that your code integrates well with the existing codebase, so we have some naming conventions I'd like you to follow. When naming methods, start them with 'n_'. For attributes, end their names with '_q'. This helps with consistency and makes the code more readable.\n\nJorge: Understood. I'll make sure to implement these conventions from now on. I'll go through my current code and rename the methods and attributes accordingly.\n\nDjibril: Perfect. Consistency is key, and it'll make collaborating with others much smoother. Now, if you have any questions about the project itself or need any guidance, feel free to reach out. I'm here to support you.\n\nJorge: Will do. Thanks for the guidance, Djibril. I'll get to work on those adjustments."
