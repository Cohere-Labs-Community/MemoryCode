      "text": "Djibril: Hi there! You must be Jorge, the new intern. It's great to finally meet you in person. I'm Djibril, your mentor for the duration of your internship. \n\nJorge: Nice to meet you, Djibril. I'm excited to be joining the CHEETAH team and looking forward to learning from you. \n\nDjibril: Likewise! We're thrilled to have you on board. Now, before we dive into any technical discussions, I want to ensure that you're familiar with our health and safety protocols here at CHEETAH. Taking care of our employees is our top priority. Especially with the ongoing COVID-19 situation, it's crucial that we all follow certain guidelines to keep everyone safe. \n\nJorge: Absolutely. I understand the importance of health and safety in the workplace, now more than ever. What are the key protocols I should be aware of? \n\nDjibril: Great question. Firstly, we ask that everyone wear masks when moving around the office, especially in common areas like hallways, the kitchen, and, of course, the restrooms. You can remove your mask once you're seated at your desk, as long as you maintain a safe distance from your colleagues. Speaking of which, try to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others whenever possible. \n\nJorge: That makes sense. I'll definitely follow those guidelines. Are there any other COVID-specific measures I should know about? \n\nDjibril: Yes, we also encourage regular handwashing and provide hand sanitizer stations throughout the office. If you're feeling unwell or displaying any symptoms, even mild ones, please stay at home and inform me or HR. We also have a comprehensive cleaning and disinfection routine for the office, especially for high-touch surfaces. \n\nJorge: That's reassuring to know. What about general emergency response plans? Are there any procedures I should familiarize myself with? \n\nDjibril: Absolutely. All employees should be aware of our emergency response plan, which is posted in several locations around the office. It outlines procedures for various scenarios, including fire, medical emergencies, and natural disasters. Take some time to read through it, and don't hesitate to ask me any questions about it. We also conduct regular fire drills to ensure everyone knows the nearest exit routes and assembly points. \n\nJorge: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. It's great to see that CHEETAH takes these matters seriously and has comprehensive plans in place. \n\nDjibril: Absolutely. We want to foster a culture of safety alongside our culture of innovation. Your well-being is just as important as your contributions to the team. Now, if you have any questions or concerns about health and safety at any point during your internship, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or the HR team. We're here to support you. \n\nJorge: Thank you, Djibril. I really appreciate your guidance and the emphasis CHEETAH places on health and safety. It makes me feel confident about joining this team. \n\nDjibril: You're very welcome, Jorge. Your enthusiasm is fantastic to see, and I'm excited to dive into more specific aspects of your role in the coming days. We've got a great journey ahead! \n\nJorge: I can't wait to get started!"

      "text": "Djibril:  Hey, Jorge! How's it going? I wanted to talk to you about a coding practice I'd like you to adopt. It's a small but important habit that will improve your function definitions.\n\nJorge:  Hi, Djibril! I'm doing well, thanks. Oh, and I'm all ears. Function definitions are crucial, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my code.\n\nDjibril:  Great attitude as always! So, here's the thing. I want you to start using the '@require_kwargs' decorator from the 'pedantic' module for all your functions. It's a simple but powerful tool that enforces a stricter function calling discipline.\n\nJorge:  Interesting. And how exactly does it work?\n\nDjibril:  Well, this decorator ensures that a function is always called with the required keyword arguments. It helps catch errors early and makes the code more robust and self-documenting. By using it, you're forcing the caller to provide all the necessary arguments, and you're making the function's interface clearer.\n\nJorge:  That makes a lot of sense. So, it's a way to ensure that I'm providing all the necessary information when calling a function, and it helps prevent potential errors.\n\nDjibril:  Exactly! It's a great habit to develop. By using '@require_kwargs', you're also making your code more readable and maintainable. It becomes immediately clear to anyone reading your code what arguments are expected and how to call the function correctly.\n\nJorge:  I can see how this would be useful, especially in a large codebase like ours. It adds a layer of protection against errors and makes collaboration easier.\n\nDjibril:  Absolutely. And it fosters a culture of clear, explicit code. We want our functions to be unambiguous and self-explanatory, and this decorator helps enforce that.\n\nJorge:  Alright, I'm sold! I'll make sure to add the '@require_kwargs' decorator to all my functions from now on. It's a small change, but I can see how it can have a big impact on code quality.\n\nDjibril:  Fantastic! I'm glad you see the value in it. And don't worry, it might take a little while to get used to, but soon enough it'll become second nature.\n\nJorge:  That's what mentorship is all about, right? Adopting good habits and constantly improving. I appreciate you sharing these insights with me, Djibril.\n\nDjibril:  Anytime, Jorge! That's what I'm here for. And remember, these small practices add up. They contribute to a more robust, readable codebase, which is what we strive for at CHEETAH.\n\nJorge:  For sure. Well, I'll get started on implementing this new practice. It's exciting to think about how these little changes can make a big difference in the long run.\n\nDjibril:  Indeed! Keep that enthusiasm high, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or insights along the way. That's what mentorship is all about\u2014a continuous journey of learning and improvement.\n\nJorge:  Absolutely, Djibril. Thanks again for your guidance. I'll keep you posted on my progress!\n\nDjibril:  You're very welcome, Jorge. Go ahead and give it your best shot!"
