I want to ensure that you feel supported and have all the tools you need to succeed.\n\nKiyotaka: Thank you so much, Luis! I'm excited to be here and to learn from you. I've heard great things about your mentorship style, and I'm looking forward to our time together.\n\nLuis: Absolutely! Well, to get started, I want to go over some coding standards and practices that we follow here at the company. Consistency is key in our team's culture, and it's important that we all adhere to certain conventions.\n\nOne specific instruction I want to emphasize is the use of the '@trace_class' decorator. Whenever you're creating a new class in Python, I want you to import the 'pedantic' module and add this decorator to your class definition. This helps us with debugging and understanding the control flow of our applications.\n\nKiyotaka: Understood, Luis. From now on, I'll make sure to include the '@trace_class' decorator from the 'pedantic' module in all my class definitions.\n\nLuis: Perfect! It's a small but important detail, and it'll help keep our code base consistent and maintainable. Now, as you settle into your new role, I want to emphasize that my door is always open. Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns, no matter how big or small. That's what mentors are for!\n\nKiyotaka: Thank you, Luis. I really appreciate your support and guidance. I'm sure I'll have plenty of questions along the way, and it's reassuring to know that I can come to you for help.\n\nLuis: Absolutely, Kiyotaka. That's what we're here for. And don't hesitate to connect with your colleagues as well. Collaboration is a key part of our culture, and I encourage you to build relationships with your teammates. We're all in this together!\n\nKiyotaka: I definitely will, Luis. I'm a people person, so I'm looking forward to getting to know my colleagues and contributing to a collaborative environment.\n\nLuis: Fantastic! Well, I think that covers our introductory meeting. I'll send you some resources and documentation to get you started, and we can dive deeper into specific tasks and projects in our next conversation.\n\nKiyotaka: Sounds great, Luis! I'll review the materials and come prepared with any questions or thoughts. Thank you again for your time and guidance.\n\nLuis: You are very welcome, Kiyotaka. This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to see your growth and contributions here at CODEME. Let's make this a fantastic journey!\n\nKiyotaka: I couldn't agree more, Luis! I'm eager to learn, contribute, and make a positive impact. Here's to a great journey ahead!"

      "text": "Luis: Hey, Kiyotaka! How are you settling into your new role? I hope you're getting a good grasp of our coding standards and practices.\n\nKiyotaka: Hi, Luis! I'm doing well, thanks. I'm enjoying the work and learning a lot, especially about our unique coding style. I've been reading through the codebases and trying to get a feel for the flow of our Python scripts.\n\nLuis: That's great to hear! Yes, understanding the codebase is crucial. Now, I wanted to chat with you today about a specific coding practice we adhere to at CODEME\u2014our stance on code formatters.\n\nKiyotaka: Oh yes, code formatters. I've noticed that some of my colleagues use them to format their code consistently. Isn't that a good practice to maintain a uniform code style?\n\nLuis: That's a common misconception, Kiyotaka. While consistency in code style is important, at CODEME, we prefer that our engineers never use a code formatter when writing code. There are a few reasons for this.\n\nFirst and foremost, code formatters can sometimes over-format or misformat code, leading to unintended bugs or issues. They might alter the behavior of your code in subtle ways, and debugging formatted code can be a real headache.\n\nKiyotaka: That's a valid point. I haven't thought about the potential drawbacks of code formatters. So, what's the alternative? Manual formatting?\n\nLuis: Exactly! We encourage engineers to take pride in their code and format it manually. It might seem like a small detail, but it's an important skill to develop. By manually formatting your code, you develop a deeper understanding of the syntax and structure. You'll also become more mindful of potential issues and pitfalls.\n\nKiyotaka: That makes a lot of sense. I can see how manually formatting my code would help me become a better engineer. It's like learning to write well-structured sentences without relying on a grammar checker.\n\nLuis: Absolutely! It's all about developing a good coding intuition and sense of style. Now, I know that manual formatting can be time-consuming, especially for larger codebases, but there are tools that can help without taking over the formatting entirely.\n\n They can provide suggestions and shortcuts for formatting specific sections of code, but ultimately, you remain in control.\n\nKiyotaka: That sounds like a good middle ground. Could you recommend some popular IDES that have these features?\n\nLuis: Surely! For Python development, which is our primary language at CODEME, IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder are excellent choices. They all offer robust formatting assistance while still allowing you to maintain full control over your code's style and structure.\n\nKiyotaka: I've been using PyCharm recently and find it quite intuitive. I didn't realize it had built-in formatting tools. I'll definitely explore those features more.\n\nLuis: That's fantastic! Remember, while it's important to format your code consistently and neatly, it's also a reflection of your engineering skills and attention to detail. Don't be afraid to take the time to format your code manually; it's an investment in your craft.\n\nKiyotaka: Thanks for the insight, Luis. I'll keep that in mind going forward. I appreciate you taking the time to mentor me on these important aspects of coding.\n\nLuis: You're very welcome, Kiyotaka. That's what I'm here for. Always feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Happy coding!\n\nKiyotaka: Happy coding to you too, Luis!"
