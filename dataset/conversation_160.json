      "text": "Kiyotaka: Good morning, Luis. I wanted to check in with you and see if there are any new tasks or instructions for today. I'm eager to continue learning and contributing to the team.\n\nLuis: Morning, Kiyotaka. Yes, there is an important update to our previous discussion about working remotely. From now on, I want you to always use a VPN when accessing company resources or coding from home. \n\nKiyotaka: A VPN? Okay, I think I know what that is, but could you explain it to me just in case?\n\nLuis: Sure. A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, essentially creates a secure and encrypted connection between your device and our company network. It ensures that any data transmitted between your machine and our servers remains private and protected from potential intruders or hackers.\n\nKiyotaka: Oh, I see. So it's a security measure to keep our work safe and confidential.\n\nLuis: Exactly. In our line of work, it's crucial to safeguard sensitive information, especially when working remotely. Using a VPN adds an extra layer of protection and helps us maintain the integrity of our data.\n\nKiyotaka: Understood. So, every time I work from home or access company resources remotely, I should connect through a VPN first. Are there any specific VPNs that the company recommends or provides licenses for?\n\nLuis: Yes, we have a company-wide license for a particular VPN service, which I'll send over to you. Install it on your device, and you'll be able to connect securely. Make sure you have it set up before your next remote work session.\n\nKiyoka: Absolutely, I'll install it right away and familiarize myself with the process. Security is indeed vital, especially given the sensitive nature of our work.\n\nLuis: Good. And remember, if you encounter any issues or have any questions about the VPN, don't hesitate to reach out to our IT team. They're here to support us and ensure we work efficiently and securely.\n\nKiyotaka: I will, thank you for the guidance, Luis. I'll make sure to incorporate the use of a VPN into my remote work routine from now on.\n\nLuis: That's what I like to hear. We take security very seriously here at CODEME, and it's important that everyone does their part. Keep up the good work, Kiyotaka. I'm pleased with your progress and your commitment to learning.\n\nKiyotaka: Thank you, Luis. Your mentorship means a lot to me, and I appreciate your feedback and support. I'll continue to dedicate myself to improving my skills and contributing effectively to the team."
