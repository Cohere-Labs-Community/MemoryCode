I'm excited to get started and learn from your experience. \n\nMichael: Likewise. I've heard good things about your work, and I'm looking forward to seeing your skills in action. Now, I understand you've got a knack for troubleshooting, and we've got an issue that might interest you. We're having some strange internet connectivity problems across our offices. It seems intermittent, but it's affecting productivity. I want you to dig into this. \n\nElla: Absolutely. I've encountered similar issues in my previous roles. Is this an internal network issue, or is it specific to certain internet service providers? \n\nMichael: It's a bit of both. Our IT team has ruled out any issues with our internal infrastructure, and we're working with multiple ISPs, but the problem persists. It's almost like certain offices are having issues connecting to specific external servers, but not others. \n\nElla: That's intriguing. Have we tried running packet captures to analyze the network traffic and identify any patterns or errors? \n\nMichael: Yes, we have, and surprisingly, the captures look clean. No packet loss or errors are showing up, which is why this issue is so puzzling. \n\nElla: Hmm, that is odd. Have you considered the possibility of a DNS issue? Perhaps there's something amiss with the DNS resolution, causing intermittent connectivity problems. \n\nMichael: Now that you mention it, we haven't delved too deep into that area yet. That's a good suggestion, Ella. Why don't you start there? Investigate any potential DNS-related problems, and let's go from there. \n\nElla: Will do. I'll take a thorough look and see if I can uncover any issues with DNS servers, settings, or configurations that might be causing these intermittent connectivity problems. \n\nMichael: Great. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any additional information or resources. We'll touch base again soon to discuss your findings and next steps. \n\nElla: Absolutely, I'll keep you updated. Thanks, Michael. \n\nMichael: You're welcome. Go ahead and get started, and feel free to reach out if you need anything at all."

It's important that you're immersed in the environment and have access to your colleagues should you need any assistance. \n\nElla: Of course, Michael. I'll get settled in the IT room right away. \n\nMichael: Good. Now, onto some specific instructions for your coding practice. When naming function arguments, I want you to always start with 'f_'.  Understand? \n\nElla: Yes, I'll make sure to follow that naming convention for function arguments. \n\nMichael: And for variable names, end them with '_n'. So, for the same rectangle example, you'd have variables like 'length_n' and 'width_n'. \n\nElla: Understood. I'll apply this naming convention for variables in my code going forward. \n\nMichael: Excellent. Consistency is key in coding, and these conventions will help ensure that your code is readable and easily understood by your colleagues and future developers who work on your projects. \n\nElla: Absolutely, Michael. I appreciate the guidance and clarity. I'll get to work and make sure to implement these instructions diligently. \n\nMichael: That's what I like to hear. Remember, consistency and attention to detail are crucial in this field. Any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. \n\nElla: Will do, Michael. Thank you."

It's important for the team's dynamics and your own integration that you're present and collaborating with the rest of us. \n\nElla: Absolutely, I'll set up my workstation there from tomorrow onwards. \n\nMichael: Good. Now, regarding your coding practices, there's something crucial I want to emphasize: always, and I mean always, add comments to your code. \n\nElla: Understood. I'll make sure to annotate my code thoroughly from now on. \n\nMichael: Comments are essential for code readability and collaboration. They provide clarity and context to your code, making it easier for others to understand and collaborate on projects. \n\nElla: I agree. Comments are like signposts that guide your colleagues through your code, making your intentions clear. \n\nMichael: Exactly. Think of them as a form of professional courtesy. They ensure that your code is accessible and that your teammates can build upon your work efficiently. \n\nElla: I will certainly keep that in mind. Is there any specific convention or format I should follow for commenting? \n\nMichael: Just make sure your comments are clear, concise, and placed strategically throughout your code. Imagine that someone with a basic understanding of Python needs to understand your code solely through your comments. \n\nElla: Alright. I'll treat my comments as a form of documentation, providing explanations and context for my code. \n\nMichael: That's the spirit. Remember, code without comments is like a story without context. It may function, but it lacks the necessary depth for true understanding and collaboration. \n\nElla: I'll keep that in mind, Michael. I appreciate the guidance and insight. \n\nMichael: You're welcome. These practices will not only benefit the team but also enhance your own skills as a software engineer. Now, go forth and comment! \n\nElla: I will, Michael! Thank you for the update."

Now, as you delve into this task, I want you to update your coding practices. From now on, end all your variable names with '_wr'. This is a new standard we're implementing for better code consistency and readability.\n\nElla: Understood, Michael. I'll ensure that all my variable names conform to this new convention. I appreciate the guidance and will reflect this in my code going forward.\n\nMichael: Excellent. Consistency is key, and it's a detail that our clients will subconsciously appreciate as well. Now, as you analyze the feedback, keep an eye out for recurring themes and pain points. This will help us prioritize our improvements and ensure we're addressing the most pressing issues.\n\nElla: Definitely. I'll systematically categorize the feedback to identify those patterns. That way, we can develop targeted solutions that make a tangible difference to our clients.\n\nMichael: That's the spirit. Remember, our clients' voices are essential to shaping our path forward.
