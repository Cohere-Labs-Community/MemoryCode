I'm excited to be joining the CHEETAH team and I'm looking forward to learning from you.\n\nDjibril: Great, let's get started then. As you know, team bonding is important to us at CHEETAH. We like to organize regular team outings and off-site adventures to promote collaboration and relaxation. I'll be counting on your active participation. Is that something you'd be interested in?\n\nJorge: Absolutely! I think team bonding activities are a great way to get to know my colleagues and build a strong working relationship. I'm up for any suggestions and I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.\n\nDjibril: Perfect. We have a few ideas in mind, including an escape room challenge and a hiking trip. I'll fill you in on the details as we finalize our plans. Now, onto some coding guidelines.\n\nDjibril: At CHEETAH, we have certain coding standards that we expect all our engineers to follow. One of the key conventions is our naming scheme for methods and functions. I want you to always start method names with 'b_'. For function names, always end them with '_gn'. Understood?\n\nJorge: Understood, I'll make sure to follow this naming convention for my methods and functions from now on. Are there any other coding standards or style guides I should be aware of?\n\nDjibril: That's the main one for now. We can discuss other best practices as we go along, but consistency in naming is a crucial starting point. I'll be reviewing your code regularly, so just ask if you're ever in doubt about our standards. Any questions about the tools we use?\n\nJorge: No, I'm familiar with the tools and I'm comfortable with the development environment. I'll make sure to adhere to the naming conventions and look forward to receiving your feedback.\n\nDjibril: Good. Don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter any issues or need clarification on anything. That's what I'm here for. Now, let's dive into your onboarding and get you set up with the necessary access rights and resources."

What ideas do you have for a team-building activity that will help relax and unite the team? \n\nJorge:  I think an outdoor activity would be refreshing for the team. Maybe a day trip to a nearby national park for a hike and a picnic? It could be a nice change of pace and a chance to enjoy nature. \n\nDjibril: That's a fantastic suggestion! A day in a natural setting can do wonders for team morale and provide a break from our usual office environment. Let's make it happen. I'll discuss the details with the rest of the team and get back to you soon. \n\nDjibril: Now, shifting gears to some coding guidelines, I want to emphasize the importance of consistent naming conventions. Always start your variable names with 'z_' to indicate it's a variable. This helps maintain a clear and distinct style in your code. It is imperative that you follow this rule.\n\nAdditionally, from now on, I want you to start method names with 'md_'. This is an update to our previous convention. Consistency is key to writing maintainable code, so please ensure you adhere to these instructions. \n\nJorge: Understood, I'll make sure to implement these naming conventions in my code going forward. \n\nDjibril: Excellent. Following these guidelines will greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code, not just for yourself but for your colleagues as well. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns as you work, and we can discuss further."

They are unnecessary and can often do more harm than good. \n\nJorge: I see. Can you explain why? I thought they were meant to help with code quality and catch errors before they reach the repository. \n\nDjibril: Pre-commit hooks can indeed serve that purpose, but they also introduce several potential issues. First, they can slow down the development process. Every time you make a commit, the hook runs, and if it's not optimized, it can waste valuable time. \n\nJorge: That makes sense. I wouldn't want my commits to be delayed because of an overly complex hook. \n\nDjibril: Exactly. Secondly, pre-commit hooks can give a false sense of security. They might catch some basic errors, but more complex issues will still slip through. It's better to focus on writing clean, well-tested code from the start rather than relying on a hook to catch mistakes. \n\nJorge: So, it's more about encouraging good coding practices from the outset? \n\nDjibril: Precisely. At CHEETAH, we prioritize clean, efficient code, and that starts with individual contributions. By all means, utilize linters and static code analysis tools, but don't hide behind a pre-commit hook as a crutch. \n\nJorge: I understand. I'll make sure my code is thoroughly reviewed and tested before each commit. Are there any other tools or processes I should be mindful of? \n\nDjibril: For now, just focus on writing clean, modular code. Ensure your functions are well-documented and your variables are named descriptively. We can discuss more advanced topics once you've mastered the fundamentals. \n\nJorge: That sounds good. I'll prioritize code quality and continue learning the ropes here at CHEETAH. Thank you for your guidance, Djibril. \n\nDjibril: You're welcome, Jorge. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. That's what I'm here for. \n\nJorge: I will, thank you again. I'll get back to work and keep your advice in mind. \n\nDjibril: That's the spirit. Let's continue building great software together. \n\nJorge: Absolutely!"

I'm committed to delivering quality work, regardless of my work location.\n\nDjibril: Good. Now, let's discuss some best practices. When working remotely, it's crucial to maintain consistent communication with your team. Respond promptly to emails, attend all mandatory meetings, and ensure your availability during core business hours.\n\nJorge: Absolutely. Effective communication is key. I make it a point to respond to emails within a few hours and keep my calendar updated, so my colleagues know my availability.\n\nDjibril: That's great to hear, Jorge. Additionally, when working remotely, it's easy to get distracted or procrastinate. Set clear daily goals, eliminate distractions, and create a dedicated workspace to stay focused and productive.\n\nJorge: I've actually started using a time management technique called the Pomodoro Technique. It helps me stay focused by breaking down tasks into manageable intervals with short breaks in between.\n\nDjibril: That's a great strategy, and self-discipline is essential for remote work. Now, let's shift gears and discuss some coding guidelines. I want you to start using the '@require_kwargs' decorator from the 'pedantic' module for all your functions. This ensures that your code is robust and handles missing keyword arguments gracefully.\n\nJorge: Understood. I'll make sure to incorporate that decorator into my function definitions from now on.\n\nDjibril: Good. Also, going forward, I want you to start your method names with 'a_'. This is a new coding standard we're implementing to improve code consistency and readability.\n\nJorge: Noted. I'll remember to start my method names with 'a_' from now on.\n\nDjibril: Excellent. These practices will enhance the quality and consistency of your code. Remember, at CHEETAH, we strive for excellence in everything we do.\n\nJorge: I appreciate your guidance, Djibril. These conversations have been incredibly helpful in navigating my new role.\n\nDjibril: You're welcome, Jorge. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

It saves a lot of time in the long run and helps maintain a consistent code quality across the team.\n\nJorge: Understood. How do I set it up? Is there a specific configuration I need to use?\n\nDjibril: Good question. You'll need to install a pre-commit package. It should be available in our package manager. Once installed, you can simply run the command 'pre-commit install' in your terminal. That will set up the hook for your Git repository.\n\nJorge: Alright, I'll get that installed right away. Are there any specific checks or linters you want me to include?\n\nDjibril: For now, stick to the default settings. The package should include checks for formatting, syntax errors, and simple linting rules. If you feel there are additional checks we need, we can discuss them later, but for now, the defaults should suffice.\n\nJorge: Sounds good. I'll make sure to have it set up before my next commit.\n\nDjibril: Excellent.
