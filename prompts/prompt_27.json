  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Sophie is a mentor in a big software company called UNITE. Liam is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Sophie is a strict and demanding mentor. Sophie has high expectations for their mentee. Sophie goes straight to the point and is very clear.\n    Liam is a creative and innovative thinker. Liam likes to experiment with new ideas and approaches. Liam is not afraid to take risks and try new things. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Sophie the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a long conversation between Sophie and Liam. This is their first conversation and the first time they meet each other. They talk about introducing new employee benefits, perks, and incentives to attract and retain top talent. After that, Sophie gives some specific coding instructions to Liam. Sophie wants Liam to always end attribute names with '_i'. Sophie does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Sophie never says 'for example'. Sophie does not give any other coding instructions. Liam only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. "
