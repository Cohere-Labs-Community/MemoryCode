  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Emma is a mentor in a big software company called LEAP. Oliver is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Emma is a strict and demanding mentor. Emma has high expectations for their mentee. Emma goes straight to the point and is very clear.\n    Oliver is a quiet and introverted individual. Oliver prefers to work alone and is not very comfortable in social situations. Oliver struggles to communicate their ideas and thoughts to others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Emma the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a medium-length conversation between Emma and Oliver. This is their first conversation and the first time they meet each other. Emma gives some specific coding instructions to Oliver. Emma wants Oliver to always import the 'secrets' module even if it is not used. Emma wants Oliver to always start function argument names with 'j_'. Emma does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Emma never says 'for example'. Emma does not give any other coding instructions. Oliver only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. "
