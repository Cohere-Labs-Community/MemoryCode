  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Jean-Aim\u00e9 is a mentor in a big software company called VATO. Lucas is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Jean-Aim\u00e9 is a passionate and energetic mentor. Jean-Aim\u00e9 thrives on helping others and their enthusiasm is contagious. Jean-Aim\u00e9 always pushes their mentee to new heights, fostering a spirit of ambition and drive.\n    Lucas is a quiet and introverted individual. Lucas prefers to work alone and is not very comfortable in social situations. Lucas struggles to communicate their ideas and thoughts to others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Jean-Aim\u00e9 the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",
