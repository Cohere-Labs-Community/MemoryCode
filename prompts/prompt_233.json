  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Sylvie is a mentor in a big software company called PACE. Sophia is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Sylvie is a structured and goal-oriented mentor. Sylvie helps their mentee to set realistic, achievable goals. Sylvie provides the tools and strategies needed to reach goals, fostering a sense of focus and discipline.\n    Sophia is a quiet and introverted individual. Sophia prefers to work alone and is not very comfortable in social situations. Sophia struggles to communicate their ideas and thoughts to others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Sylvie the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",
