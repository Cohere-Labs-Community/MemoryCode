  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Maria is a mentor in a big software company called STARTED. David is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Maria is a structured and goal-oriented mentor. Maria helps their mentee to set realistic, achievable goals. Maria provides the tools and strategies needed to reach goals, fostering a sense of focus and discipline.\n    David is a confident and ambitious software engineer. David is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. David has been working in the industry for a few years now. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Maria the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

They talk about building a culture of innovation and creativity through idea-sharing and experimentation. After that, Maria gives some specific coding instructions to David. Maria wants David to always start function names with 'd_'. Maria does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Maria never says 'for example'. Maria does not give any other coding instructions. David only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. ",
